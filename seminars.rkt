Instead, they embrace the loosely-coupled development and deployment of services that communicate via simple network protocols. Even though these applications do expose interfaces that are higher-order in spirit, the simplicity of the network protocols forces them to rely on brittle low-level encodings. To bridge the apparent semantic gap, programmers introduce ad-hoc and error-prone defensive code. Inspired by Design by Contract, we choose a different route to bridge this gap. We introduce Whip, a contract system for modern services. Whip (i) provides programmers with a higher-order contract language tailored to the needs of modern services; and (ii) monitors services at run time to detect services that do not live up to their advertised interfaces. Contract monitoring is local to a service. Services are treated as black boxes, allowing heterogeneous implementation languages without modification to services' code. Thus, Whip does not disturb the loosely coupled nature of modern services.}}

As coined by Philip Wadler in 1998, EP is a new name for an old problem. Given a data type defined by cases, consider two independent extensions, namely, adding new cases to the data type and new functions over the datatype. Dozens of papers in the research literature present their solutions to the EP, using a variety of programming languages and approaches. In this talk I present a Scala-based framework that can synthesize full solutions to the EP problem. The first step is to model the domain of interest (such as mathematical expressions or geometric shapes) to ensure that our synthesized code can work with any desired application domain. Second, we demonstrate how to synthesize code that reproduces a dozen EP solutions from the literature, in C++, Java and Haskell. We designed a common API for all approaches, independent of programming language. While we do not introduce any new approach for EP, we explore the challenges that EP solutions face with binary methods and producer methods. An important contribution of this work is the scientific reproduction of known solutions from the literature.

Control operators (call-cc, shift/reset, etc.)  are a well-established abstraction for user-defined effects, and I will consider the specific shift/dollar without answer-type-modification. Since the 90s, functional languages have used monads for user-defined effects, and I will consider Filinski's monadic reflection. In the last decade, the community started looking into Plotkin and Pretnar's handlers for algebraic effects (extensible effects in Haskell, OCaml multicore, the Eff, Frank, Koka, and Links programming languages) as a programming abstraction, and I will consider deep handlers without forwarding. I will compare the relative expressive power of these three abstractions using Felleisen's notion of macro-translations.

     @list{@p{Deep learning is formulated around backpropagation, a method for computing gradients of a particular class of data flow graphs to train models to minimize error by gradient descent.  Backpropagation is a special case of a more general method known as reverse mode automatic differentiation (AD) for computing gradients of functions expressed as programs.  Reverse mode AD imposes only a small constant-factor overhead in operation count over the original computation, but has storage requirements that grow, in the worst case, in proportion to the time consumed by the original computation.  This storage blowup can be ameliorated by check pointing, a process that reorders application of classical reverse-mode AD over an execution interval to tradeoff space vs. time.  Application of check pointing in a divide-and-conquer fashion to strategically chosen nested execution intervals can break classical reverse-mode AD into stages which can reduce the worst-case growth in storage from linear to logarithmic.  Doing this has been fully automated only for computations of particularly simple form, with checkpoints spanning execution intervals resulting from a limited set of program constructs.  We show how the technique can be automated for arbitrary computations.  Doing so relies on implementing general purpose mechanisms for counting the number of instructions executed by a program, interrupting the execution after a specified number of steps, and resuming the execution with a nonstandard interpretation.  We implement these general purpose mechanisms with a compiler that converts programs to continuation-passing style (CPS).  The process of efficiently computing gradients with check pointing requires running, and rerunning, little bits of the program out of order.  This is made easier by applying the technique to functional programs. There is a deeper and higher-level message in this talk: machine learning can benefit from advanced techniques from programming language theory.}}

Matthews and Ahmed (2008) gave a proof of parametricity for a closely related system that combines ML and Scheme, but later found a flaw in their proof. In this work we prove that the polymorphic blame calculus satisfies relational parametricity. The proof relies on a step-indexed Kripke logical relation. The step-indexing is required to make the logical relation well-defined in the case for the dynamic type. The possible worlds include the mapping of generated type names to their concrete types and the mapping of type names to relations. We prove the Fundamental Property of this logical relation and that it is sound with respect to contextual equivalence.}}

In practice, it always takes much more time and effort to find the simple/orthogonal presentation than to come up with the desirable features, and we become emotionally attached to programming language monoliths (C++, Scala, GHC Haskell, OCaml, Common Lisp...) that suffer from feature creep. An alternative is to design programming systems as multi-language environment instead. This point of view makes it easier to detect flaws in a proposed programming system design: there is no clear objective definition of what "orthogonal features" really mean, but we have clear ideas of how multi-language systems should work. The Racket Manifesto says: "Each language and component must be able to protect its specific invariants".}@p{In this work we give a formal specification, in terms of full abstraction, for what it means for a new language added to the system to not introduce "abstraction leaks" in the other languages, and discuss scenarios where this translates in (informal) usability properties: having a nice teachable language subset, or gracefully introducing an advanced language for experts. We present a multi-language design that exhibits this formal property by adding a language L with linear types and linear state to a typical ML-style programming language U. L allows to write programs with resource usage guarantees (space consumption, typestate-style safety guarantees) that were not possible in U, without introducing abstraction leaks.

Unfortunately, there are no existing tools to detect such vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present HybriDroid, the first static analysis framework for Android hybrid apps. First, we investigate the semantics of interoperation of Android Java and JavaScript. Then, we design and implement a static analysis framework that analyzes inter-communication between Android Java and JavaScript. We demonstrate HybriDroid with a bug detector that identifies programmer errors due to the hybrid semantics, and a taint analyzer that finds information leaks cross language boundaries. Our empirical evaluation shows that the tools are practically usable in that they found previously uncovered bugs in real-world Android hybrid apps and possible information leaks via a widely-used advertising platform.}@p{The bulk of this presentation will focus on ASE 2016 work on analysis of hybrid apps (1), a blend of per-platform native code and portable JavaScript.

An alternate approach is to use Datalog, a declarative language. Implementors can express analysis constraints declaratively, which makes it easier to understand and ensure correctness of the analysis. Furthermore, the declarative nature of the analysis allows multiple, independent analyses to be easily combined.}

These two extensions, user-defined lattices and functions, allow Flix to support analyses that cannot be expressed by Datalog, such as a constant propagation analysis. Datalog is limited to constraints on relations, and although it can simulate finite lattices, it cannot express lattices over an infinite domain. Finally, another advantage of Flix is that it supports interoperability with existing tools written in general-purpose programming languages.}

A key limitation of classical symbolic execution is that it cannot generate useful test inputs if the program under test uses complex operations such as pointer manipulations and non-linear arithmetic operations.}
            @p{Our research on Concolic Testing (also known as DART: Directed Automated Random Testing or Dynamic Symbolic Execution) alleviated the limitations of classical symbolic execution by combining concrete execution and symbolic execution.  We demonstrated that concolic testing is an effective technique for generating high-coverage test suites and for finding deep errors in complex software applications. The success of concolic testing in scalably and exhaustively testing real-world software was a major milestone in the ad hoc world of software testing and has inspired the development of several industrial and academic automated testing and security tools.}
            @p{One of the key challenges of concolic testing is the huge number of programs paths in all but the smallest programs, which is usually exponential in the number of static branches in the code.  In this talk I will describe MultiSE, a new technique for merging states incrementally during symbolic execution, without using auxiliary variables. The key idea of MultiSE is based on an alternative representation of the state, where we map each variable, including the program counter, to a set of guarded symbolic expressions called a value summary. MultiSE has several advantages over conventional symbolic execution and state merging techniques: 1) value summaries enable sharing of symbolic expressions and path constraints along multiple paths, 2) value-summaries avoid redundant execution, 3) MultiSE does not introduce auxiliary symbolic values, which enables it to make progress even when merging values not supported by the constraint solver, such as floating point or function values.  We have implemented MultiSE for JavaScript programs in a publicly available open-source tool. Our evaluation of MultiSE on several programs shows that MultiSE can run significantly faster than traditional symbolic execution.}}

In this talk, I will show that automated analysis techniques can help to identify and reason about software behavior characteristics that matter to humans. After a brief overview of my current research directions, I will focus on techniques for identifying privacy violations in mobile applications, i.e., leakages of sensitive information such as user location and shopping preferences. I will present a set of solutions that rely on contextual, functional and usage-based clues for improving the accuracy of leakage detection and for distinguishing between “legitimate” and “illegitimate” information distribution patterns.}

However, current formal characterisations do not fully capture capability-safety of a programming language and are not sufficient for verifying typical applications. Using state-of-the-art techniques from programming languages research, we define a logical relation for a core calculus of JavaScript that better characterises capability-safety. The relation is powerful enough to reason about typical capability patterns and supports evolvable invariants on shared data structures, capabilities with restricted authority over them and isolated components with restricted communication channels. We use a novel notion of effect parametricity for deriving properties about effects. We demonstrate that our results imply memory access bounds that have previously been used to characterise capability-safety.}

           Weak memory models formalize the inconsistent behaviors that one can observe in multithreaded programs running on modern hardware. In so doing, they complicate the already-difficult task of reasoning about correctness of concurrent code. Worse, they render impotent most formal methods that have been developed to tame concurrency, which almost universally assume a strong (i.e., sequentially consistent) memory model. In response, we have developed a number of alternative reasoning techniques that are sound for programs running weak memory consistency. I will cover both program logics, such as relaxed separation logic, as well as theorems that allow reducing reasoning about well-structured weakly consistent implementations down to sequential consistency, and show how these can be applied to reason about a practical RCU implementation.}}

         This talk is about scalloc, a fast, multicore-scalable, low-fragmentation memory allocator and selfie, a 4000-line implementation of a tiny self-compiling C compiler and a tiny self-executing MIPS emulator for teaching systems engineering. Scalloc is a typical example of a very complex, multi-year research effort while selfie is, at least for now, a purely educational, many-year effort in teaching compiler, operating system, and virtual machine design based on a single, highly principled software platform. So far scalloc and selfie only share the passion of their authors and are otherwise two distinct projects. Yet earlier versions of selfie, before they were even identified as such, were instrumental in bringing up the generation of students who did scalloc.
        The main ideas behind scalloc are: uniform treatment of small and big objects through so-called virtual spans, efficiently and effectively reclaiming free memory through fast and scalable global data structures, and constant-time (modulo synchronization) allocation and deallocation operations that trade off memory reuse and spatial locality without being subject to false sharing. The main ideas behind selfie are: a compiler written in and for a tiny subset of C called C* which uses the dereferencing * operator of C for memory access but lacks data structures and many other features and a MIPS emulator written in C* that can execute itself. Both are combined and extended by students to do very cool stuff.

  Memory corruption plagues systems since the dawn of computing. With the
rise of defense techniques like stack cookies, ASLR, and DEP, attacks
have become much more complicated, yet control-flow hijack attacks are
still prevalent. Attacks leverage code reuse attacks, often using some
form of information disclosure. Stronger defense mechanisms have been
proposed but none have seen wide deployment so far (i) due to the time
it takes to deploy a security mechanism, (ii) incompatibility with
specific features, and (iii) most severely due to performance overhead.
In the talk, we evaluate the security benefits and limitations of the
status quo and look into upcoming defense mechanisms (and their attacks).

Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) and Code-Pointer Integrity (CPI) are two of
the hottest upcoming defense mechanisms. CFI guarantees that the runtime
control flow follows the statically determined control-flow graph. An
attacker may reuse any of the valid transitions at any control flow
transfer. CPI on the other hand is a dynamic property that enforces
memory safety guarantees like bounds checks for code pointers by
separating code pointers from regular data. We will discuss differences
and advantages/disadvantages of both approaches, especially the security
benefits they give under novel attacks like Counterfeit Object-Oriented
Programming (COOP) and Control-Flow Bending (CFB).  COOP reuses complete
functions as gadgets and CFB bends the control flow along valid but
unintended paths in the control-flow graph of a program.

              Modern verification techniques are becoming
        ever-more powerful and sophisticated, and building tools to implement
        them is a time-consuming and difficult task. Writing a new verifier to
        validate each on-paper approach is impractical; for this reason
        intermediate verification languages such as Boogie and Why3 have become
        popular over the last decade. However, verification approaches geared
        around complex program logics (such as separation logic) have typically
        been implemented in specialised tools, since the reasoning is hard to
        map down to first-order automated reasoning. In practice, this means
        that a rich variety of modern techniques have no corresponding tool
        support.  In this talk, I will present the new Silver intermediate
        verification language, which has been designed to facilitate the
        lightweight implementation of a variety of modern methodologies for
        program verification. In contrast to lower-level verification languages,
        Silver provides native support for heap reasoning; modes of reasoning
        such as concurrent separation logic, dynamic frames and
        rely-guarantee/invariants can be simply encoded.  Silver has been
        developed as part of the Viper project, which provides two automated
        back-end verifiers for Silver programs. Since releasing our software in
        September last year, it has been used for (internal and external)
        projects to build tools for Java verification, non-blocking concurrency
        reasoning, flow-sensitive typing and reasoning about GPU and Linux
        kernel code.
