                    Finally, if you haven't already found a place to live, this
                    map (compiled by Northeastern CS grad students) can help
                    you narrow down where to live in Boston. Colors on shaded
                    regions indicate roughly how good the area is for grad
                    students (green = good, yellow = okay, red = bad), and you
                    can click on the regions and pins for more information
