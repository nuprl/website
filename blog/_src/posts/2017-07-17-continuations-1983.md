I first encountered this essay on continuations in a green folder in the PRL.
It turns out, the author spent a semester at Indiana University working on the
 [same fringe problem](http://wiki.c2.com/?SameFringeProblem) for a graduate-level programming languages course.
According to [the instructor](https://www.cs.indiana.edu/~dfried/):
 "What he said was true.  He could not stop thinking about the problem the entire semester."
This essay was a kind of final exam.
