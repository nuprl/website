Over the past 50 years, which result from programming languages research
has had the greatest impact on working programmers?

<!-- more -->

The center of the universe for a working programmer is the language
(or languages) they use. Fundamental results in programming languages (PL)
research can re-shape this universe.

In [HOPL](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/7480-s17/index.html) two weeks ago,
Matthias claimed that _type soundness_ is the most useful
and influential result to flow from PL research to PL practice in the last 50
years.

But 50 years is a long time, and there are many serious contenders for the
title of _greatest PL result_. Here are my (alphabetized) picks for the top five:


### Abstraction

By _abstraction_, I mean anything whose interface is not just "read the implementation".
Could be a tuple, module, object, structure, semaphore, macro, etc.
Even the memory hierarchy pyramid in your operating systems textbook is an
abstraction.
They are everywhere, and they are what separates computer science (it's about
_ideas_) from electrical engineering (it's about _transistors_).
Thank you [Peter Landin](/img/l-plp-1965.pdf) and [J.H. Morris](/img/m-thesis-1969.pdf).


### Generational Garbage Collection

I don't know much about garbage collection.
I do know that I want it, and I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't have it (outside
of research languages) without generational garbage collection.
Thank you [David Ungar](/img/u-sde-1984.pdf).


### Generic Programming

_a.k.a. the mainstream interpretations of parametric polymorphism_

The thought of programming in Java 1.4 is terrifying.
Thank you [Jean-Yves Girard](/img/g-thesis-1972.pdf)
and [John C. Reynolds](/img/r-cp-1974.pdf)
and [Gilad Bracha and Martin Odersky and David Stoutamire and Philip Wadler](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/gj/).


### Modularization

How can humans understand large software systems?
By organizing the systems into smaller components (modules, objects) with
well-defined interfaces.
It's hard to imagine, but once upon a time the question of _how_ to divide
a system into modules was a new research problem.
Thank you [D.L. Parnas](/img/p-tr-1971.pdf).


### Type Soundness

Let me make two modest claims:

- Soundness (with respect to a dynamic semantics) is a desirable property for a static type system.
- A large number (at least, thousands) of working programmers agree that programming in a language with a sound, static type system is "a good thing".

Neither of these claims were true 50 years ago.
They are definitely true today.
And the slogan "well typed programs do not go wrong (up to a well-defined set of runtime errors)" has become the catchphrase of PL research.
Thank you [Robin Milner](/img/m-jcss-1978.pdf).
