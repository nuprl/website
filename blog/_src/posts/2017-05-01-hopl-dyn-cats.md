In 1969, Dana Scott wrote an [unpublished manuscript][alternative] in
which he said untyped lambda calculus had no mathematical meaning, 11
years later he wrote [a paper][relating] that organized many of the
different semantics he and others had since found using the language
of category theory.

This latter paper is really the first deserving of the title
"categorical semantics of dynamic typing", and so I'm going to present
some of the theorems and "theorems" presented in that paper, but
mingled with the history of the idea and the preceding papers that led
to them.
