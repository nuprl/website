You might recognize the opening line from Joyce Kilmer's 1914 poem [_Trees_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trees_(poem)),
or from Radia Perlman's [_Algorhyme_](/img/p-sigcomm-1985.pdf) (published 1985).

The poem is online in [at least one other place](http://mercury.lcs.mit.edu/~jnc/humour/lisp.tree),
but the copy linked above (from [BYTE magazine](https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine))
comes with a footnote on _How this poem came to be printed_.
