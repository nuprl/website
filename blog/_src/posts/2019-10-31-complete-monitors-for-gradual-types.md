Syntactic type soundness is too weak to tell apart different ways of running
 a program that mixes typed and untyped code.
Complete monitoring is a stronger property that captures a meaningful
 distinction --- a language satisfies complete monitoring iff it checks
 all interactions between typed and untyped code.

### Example: Clickable Plot

The program below has a subtle bug.
Can you find it?

<img src="/img/complete-monitoring-0.png" alt="Untyped client code, a typed API, and untyped library code."/>

First of all, this pseudocode program combines three chunks of code:

- On the left, an **untyped** client script defines a function `h` that expects
  a pair of numbers and returns an image. The client uses this function to
  create a `ClickPlot` object, and then displays the plot --- ideally in a new
  GUI window.

- In the center, a **typed** API file describes a `ClickPlot` object as
  something with one constructor and two methods. The constructor expects
  a function; according to the type, such functions can expect a pair of
  numbers and must compute an image. The `mouseHandler` method expects
  a `MouseEvt` object and returns nothing. The `show` method expects no arguments
  and returns nothing. (Presumably, these methods have side effects.)

- On the right, an **untyped** library module implements a `ClickPlot` object.
  Most of the code is omitted (`...`), but the `mouseHandler` method sends
  its input directly to the `onClick` callback.

The **bug** is in the API --- in the type `([N, N]) => Image`.
This type promises that a given function can expect a pair of numbers,
 and indeed the client function `h` expects a pair.
But the library code on the right sends a `MouseEvt` object.

What happens when we run this program in a type-sound mixed-typed language?
Does `h` receive the invalid input?

As it turns out, type soundness cannot say.
A type sound language may choose to enforce or ignore the fact that the
 API promises a pair of numbers to the client.


### Type Soundness is Not Enough

Sound types are statements about the behavior of a program.
A normal type soundness theorem for a typed language says that a well-typed
 program can either compute a value of the same type, compute forever (diverge),
 or stop with an acceptable error (perhaps division by zero).
No other behaviors are possible.

A mixed-typed language needs two "type soundness" theorems:
 one for typed code and one for untyped code.
The **typed** soundness theorem can resemble a classic theorem.
The **untyped** soundness theorem is necessarily a weaker statement due to
 the lack of types:

> - `e -->* v` and `v : T`
> - `e` diverges
> - `e -->* OkError`
>
> And if `e` is untyped then one of the following holds:
>
> - `e -->* v` and `v` is an untyped value
> - `e` diverges
> - `e -->* OkError`

Now we can see why mixed-typed soundness is not strong enough to guarantee that
 the callback `h` in the code above receives a pair value.
We have an **untyped** function called from an **untyped** context --- since
 there are no types sitting right there, type soundness has nothing to say
 except that the untyped code can expect an untyped value!

Nevertheless, this channel of communication between the library and client
 arose through the typed API.
One might expect the type `[N, N]` to restrict the values that can flow across
 the channel; indeed, if types really are statements about the behavior of a program,
 then the channel needs to be protected.

The question is: what formal property separates languages thet check
 all typed/untyped channels of communication (whether direct or derived)?
One answer is complete monitoring.


### Complete Monitoring

A mixed-typed language satisfies complete monitoring iff evaluation never
 lets a value flow un-checked across a type boundary.
To make this idea precise, we need to enrich the syntax of the language
 with a specification of _ownership_ to say what parts of the program are
 responsible for different values, and to say how evalution changes
 responsibilities.
Relative to a specification, complete monitoring states that every expression
 that arises during evaluation is made up of parts that each have a single
 owner.

> For all well-formed `e` and all `e'`, if `e -->* e'` then every subexpression
> of `e'` has a unique owner.

This property separates our two behaviors for the Clickable Plot code.
A language that satisfies complete monitoring enforces the API types with
 a runtime check.
A language that merely satisfies type soundness may skip these checks.


### An Aid to Debugging

The question raised by the Clickable Plot example is whether a language can
 **detect** one mismatch between a type and a value.
A language that satisfies complete monitoring detects all such mis-matches.
But we can say more.
If a mismatch occurs, then programmer knows exactly where to start debugging
 --- either the type is an incorrect specification, or the given value is
 flawed.
In other words, complete monitoring implies a concise 2-party explanation
 for every type mismatch.

The paper generalizes this goal of explaining a mismatch for languages
 that fail to satisfy complete monitoring.
There may be 2N parties to blame thanks to un-checked channels of communication,
 and we want to be certain to report all these parties and no false positives.

Also in the paper, you can find:

- a model of ownership, clear _laws_ for how ownership changes during evaluation;
- examples of how to systematically add ownership to an operational semantics
  to attempt a proof of complete monitoring;
- definitions for **blame soundness** and **blame completeness**;
- an analysis of three semantics, which correspond to [Typed Racket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/ts-reference/index.html),
  [Transient Reticulated](http://hdl.handle.net/2022/23172), and a compromise;
- and discussion of an alternative, heap-based model of ownership.
