The Racket School 2018: Create your own language • 9–13 July • Salt Lake City

<!-- more -->

The Racket team has spent over thirty years developing and refining a
coherent intellectual tradition for studying and building programming
languages. This year’s school will introduce participants to Racket’s
framework for language-oriented programming, which the summer school
faculty recently spelled out in a a cover article in the
[Communications of the ACM](https://tinyurl.com/RacketCACM)

Concretely, the 2018 Racket Summer School will cover the following
topics:

- the spectrum of programming languages;
- modules and syntax, or languages as libraries;
- DrRacket’s support for language-oriented programming;
- a domain-specific language for adding types to languages;
- tools and techniques for implementing notational conveniences; and
- research challenges in language-oriented programming.

If these topics intrigue you, attend the Racket Summer School:

This is not your run-of-the-mill summer school. We will do our best to
make it exciting, entertaining, and useful to a broad spectrum of
attendees, both academic and industrial.

P.S. We will send you your first problem set in June, a month before
the summer school to whet your appetite.<Paste>
