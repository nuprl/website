    Title: Measuring the submission/review balance

How do researchers know whether they are doing "enough" or "too many"
reviews? A measurable goal is to be review-neutral: to have demanded,
through our submissions, as many reviews as we have produced as
reviewers.

### Reviewing is good

I like to review academic papers. It is a very rewarding activity in
many different ways. One gets to serve the academic community, helping
it function smoothly. One gets a chance at acquiring a much better
understanding of someone else's work than idle paper-skimming
allows. One gets to send feedback to our colleagues and help them
improve their work and its presentation -- it is also an essential way
in which we can participate to the formation of student researchers
all over the world. Finally, doing reviews helped me develop the skill
the judge someone else's work and of forcing oneself to come up with
a decisive opinion -- it is surprisingly difficult and only comes with
training.

Doing reviews is also fairly time-consuming. I noticed that the time
I spend on each review is generally stable (excursions into previous
or related work excluded): around one day and a half for conference
reviews, and at least twice more for journal reviews -- I'm sure other
people have wildly different figures, but I would expect it to be
a noticeable time commitment in any case. (Workshop reviews are much
easier, at least for the formats I have seen of 2-page extended
abstracts, I'd say one hour per review.)

### How many reviews?

Because it is so time-consuming, deciding whether to say "yes" or "no"
to invitations to review a new paper is not easy: in general I want to
say "yes" (unless I can tell that I will not enjoy reading the paper
at all), but it is not reasonable to say "yes" all the time, because
I also need to spend time on other things. When should I say "no"
because I have done "too many" reviews already?

We can count the number of reviews that we have done, and we can also
estimate the number of reviews that we have demanded of others through
our submissions. A natural goal for researchers is to produce at least
as many reviews as they demand; if everyone reached this goal, the
peer-review system would be at equilibrium without imposing too much
of a workload on anyone.

To estimate the number of reviews a researcher demanded from their
peers, you can sum, for each of their submissions to a peer-reviewed
venue, the number of reviews that they received, divided by the total
number of authors of the submissions.

\\[ \sum_{p \in \mathtt{Submissions}} \frac{\mathtt{reviews}(p)}{\mathtt{authors}(p)} \\]

Out of curiosity, I just measured this balance for myself: over my
years doing research I have "demanded" 10 workshop reviews and 28.5
conference reviews, and "produced" 6 workshop reviews and 17
conference reviews. If you think that an article would interest me,
you shouldn't feel bad about asking me to review it, for now. (On the
other hand, my balance *this year* is positive, so I wouldn't feel to
bad about refusing if I had to.)

Of course, a researcher's balance is highly dependent on where they
are in their academic career -- maybe more so that on their personal
choices. Students are supposed to submit articles, but are offered few
opportunities for doing reviews. When they are invited to do reviews,
it is often as sub-reviewer, one review at a time. More established
researchers participate in program committees, where they have to do
a fair amount of reviews at once -- ten to twenty can be typical in
Programming Languages conferences. This means that one naturally
starts with a deficit of reviews, and that the opportunity to become
balanced or positive only comes over the years.

(There is much more that could be said about the dynamics of the
submission/review balance. I think the idea that a single person
should be neutral should not be taken too seriously, because the
dynamics are so complex. For example, some people stop doing reviews
with a negative balance (students going to the industry for example),
so long-time researchers necessarily have a *very positive* balance
that may make short-time researchers balance considerations mostly
irrelevant. Another thing is that there is no point doing more reviews
than required by the submission flow, and that doing more reviews
would build up more reviewing debt under this neutrality criterion --
you can never have everyone positive.)

### Quality

This is only a comment on the quantitative aspects of reviewing. Much
more important is the qualitative part: are the reviews you receive
and produce good reviews? (There is no objective definition of what
a good review is; I like reviews that are constructive, help improve
the work and its presentation, and catch mistakes.) For a given paper,
one or a few very good reviews is more helpful than many bad reviews,
so one should not compromise on the quality of one's reviews in order
to reach a quantitative goal.


### Advice for students?

While proof-reading this post (thanks!), Ben asked some questions that
may be of interest to others -- mostly students, I suppose.

The answer is of course "no": one should never feel forced to accept
reviews. On the other hand, I do think that it is worthwhile for PhD
students to take advantage of the reviews they are offered, so "saying
yes most of the time" sounds like a reasonable strategy to me -- this
is just a personal opinion. Some reasons:

- Reviewing is hard and takes training, I think it is good to start
  practicing early. Students are in a good situation to exercise their
  reviewing skills at a fairly calm peace (you won't get many
  reviews anyway), and with more time than more senior people.

- Student reviews are often done as sub-reviewer: someone does
  a review, but also asks for your opinion and includes your
  sub-review in their review. It is a low-pressure way to do your
  first reviews, and the ability to exchange opinions with the other
  reviewer and discuss both reviews is really helpful. Students can
  also ask for feedback on their reviews to their advisor, which is
  also very helpful.

- Reviewing teaches a few useful things about writing papers as
  well -- it's always easier to recognize the flaws in others' work.

On the other hand, I think you should not accept reviews at times when
you cannot invest enough work in the review, or when doing so would be
detrimental to you -- whether you are on a deadline, or under too much
pressure, or have conflicting commitments, etc. This is more important
than anything about a submission/review balance.

Yes, you can volunteer for reviews by telling the colleagues in your
lab that you would be interested in doing reviews and that they should
consider giving you some.

(With the increased use of double-blind submission processes, it is
becoming more difficult to pass conference reviews to external
researchers. This means that students are relatively unlikely to
receive review offers from outside their close colleagues.)

Besides doing more reviews, the two other factors one could in theory
play with are: submitting less papers, and having more
co-authors. I think there is something to be said for the first one:
one reason to not submit unfinished, buggy or topically-inappropriate
articles is that it has a review cost. The second factor should not be
considered, I think: "did this person contribute to the work?" should
weight infinitely more for co-authorship decisions.

Note: Another thing you can ask for is *reading reviews other people
received*. I think that reading reviews is also very helpful for
research beginners -- whether reviews of one's own work or someone
else's. In particular, I wouldn't know how to write reviews if
I hadn't had the opportunity to read reviews before that. If someone
you are close to receives reviews, you should consider asking them
whether you could have a look.

> Is being a student volunteer at a conference equal to "one review"?

I think it is a distinct form of academic service. I don't know how to
measure the "conference organization cost" we impose to our academic
colleagues. (If there are around 500 attendants to a typical
Programming Languages conference, it means that for every 500
conferences you attend you should organize one all by yourself.)
