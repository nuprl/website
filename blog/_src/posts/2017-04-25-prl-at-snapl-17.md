PRL recently produced three papers for the
[SNAPL](http://snapl.org/2017/index.html) conference.

- [Linking Types for Multi-Language Software: Have Your Cake and Eat
  It Too](https://dbp.io/pubs/2017/linking-types-snapl.pdf), by Daniel
  Patterson and Amal Ahmed.
- [Search for Program Structure](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/gasche/research/canonical-forms/snapl.pdf),
  by Gabriel Scherer
- [Migratory Typing: Ten Years
  Later](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/racket/pubs/typed-racket.pdf), by Sam
  Tobin-Hochstadt, Matthias Felleisen, Robert Bruce Findler, Matthew
  Flatt, Ben Greenman, Andrew M. Kent, Vincent St-Amour, T. Stephen
  Strickland and Asumu Takikawa

### [Linking Types for Multi-Language Software: Have Your Cake and Eat
  It Too](https://dbp.io/pubs/2017/linking-types-snapl.pdf)

Daniel Patterson and Amal Ahmed, 2017

> Software developers compose systems from components written in many different
> languages. A business-logic component may be written in Java or OCaml, a
> resource-intensive component in C or Rust, and a high-assurance component in
> Coq. In this multi-language world, program execution sends values from one
> linguistic context to another. This boundary-crossing exposes values to contexts
> with unforeseen behavior—that is, behavior that could not arise in the source
> language of the value. For example, a Rust function may end up being applied in
> an ML context that violates the memory usage policy enforced by Rust’s type
> system. This leads to the question of how developers ought to reason about code
> in such a multi-language world where behavior inexpressible in one language is
> easily realized in another.
>
> This paper proposes the novel idea of linking types to address the problem of
> reasoning about single-language components in a multi-lingual setting.
> Specifically, linking types allow programmers to annotate where in a program
> they can link with components inexpressible in their unadulterated language.
> This enables developers to reason about (behavioral) equality using only their
> own language and the annotations, even though their code may be linked with code
> written in a language with more expressive power.


### [Search for Program Structure](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/gasche/research/canonical-forms/snapl.pdf)

Gabriel Scherer, 2017.

> The community of programming language research loves the
> Curry-Howard correspondence between proofs and
> programs. Cut-elimination as computation, theorems for free,
> 'call/cc' as excluded middle, dependently typed languages as proof
> assistants, etc.
>
> Yet we have, for all these years, missed an obvious observation:
> "the structure of *programs* corresponds to the structure of proof
> *search*". For pure programs and intuitionistic logic, more is known
> about the latter than the former. We think we know what programs
> are, but logicians know better!
>
> To motivate the study of proof search for program structure, we
> retrace recent research on applying the logical technique of focusing
> to study the canonical structure of simply-typed λ-terms. We then
> motivate the open problem of extending canonical forms to support
> richer type systems, such as polymorphism, by discussing a few
> enticing applications of more canonical program representations.

### [Migratory Typing: Ten Years Later](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/racket/pubs/typed-racket.pdf)

Sam Tobin-Hochstadt, Matthias Felleisen, Robert Bruce Findler, Matthew
Flatt, Ben Greenman, Andrew M. Kent, Vincent St-Amour, T. Stephen
Strickland and Asumu Takikawa, 2017.

> In this day and age, many developers work on large, untyped code
> repositories. Even if they are the creators of the code, they notice
> that they have to figure out the equivalent of method signatures
> every time they work on old code. This step is time consuming and
> error prone.
>
> Ten years ago, the two lead authors outlined a linguistic solution
> to this problem. Specifically they proposed the creation of typed
> twins for untyped programming languages so that developers could
> migrate scripts from the untyped world to a typed one in an
> incremental manner. Their programmatic paper also spelled out three
> guiding design principles concerning the acceptance of grown idioms,
> the soundness of mixed-typed programs, and the units of migration.
>
> This paper revisits this idea of a migratory type system as
> implemented for Racket. It explains how the design principles have
> been used to produce the Typed Racket twin and presents an
> assessment of the project’s status, highlighting successes and
> failures.

SNAPL is not dissimilar to the (french-speaking)
[JFLA](http://jfla.inria.fr/) that I am more familiar with --- with an
added irritating call for paper and unreasonable registration
price. It has an interesting diversity of topics of presentation: see
also the complete [list of accepted
papers](http://snapl.org/2017/papers.html) this year, and the [list of
the previous edition](http://snapl.org/2015/papers.html).
