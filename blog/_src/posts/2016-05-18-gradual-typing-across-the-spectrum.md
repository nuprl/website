Yesterday we hosted a PI meeting for the [Gradual Typing Across the Spectrum](http://prl.ccs.neu.edu/gtp/)
NSF grant, gathering researchers from a number of institutions who work on
gradual typing (the meeting program can be found [here](http://prl.ccs.neu.edu/gtp/pi2016/pi2016.html)).
In case you aren't familiar with gradual typing, the idea is
to augment dynamically typed languages (think Python or Ruby) with static
type annotations (as documentation, for debugging, or for tool support)
that are guaranteed to be sound.

Gradual typing is these days a fairly popular area, but
the research can seem fragmentary
because of the need to support idiosyncratic language features. One of the
points of the meeting was to encourage the cross-pollination of the key
scientific ideas of gradual typing---the ideas that cross language
and platform barriers.

There were a good number of both institutions and programming languages
represented at the meeting, with researchers from all of [Brown University](http://cs.brown.edu/research/plt/),
[Indiana University](https://wonks.github.io/), [Northeastern University](http://prl.ccs.neu.edu/),
and the [University of Maryland](http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/PL/).
The languages that we work on cover a broad subset of the dynamically-typed
languages: Clojure, JavaScript, R, Racket, Ruby, Pyret, and Python.

The specific research artifacts that were represented include
[Reticulated Python](https://github.com/mvitousek/reticulated),
[RDL](https://github.com/plum-umd/rdl) (contracts for Ruby),
[StrongScript](http://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~dynjs/strongscript/),
[Typed Clojure](http://typedclojure.org/),
and [Typed Racket](http://docs.racket-lang.org/ts-guide/index.html).

In this blog post, I'll summarize some of the key research themes
that were brought up at the meeting. Since I can't go into too much
detail about every topic, I will link to the relevant research
papers and other resources.

At a high level, the talks covered four major facets of gradual typing:
expressiveness, performance, usability, and implementation techniques.

## Expressiveness

By expressiveness, I mean what kinds of language features a gradual type
system supports and the richness of the reasoning that the type system provides.
Since gradual typing is about augmenting existing dynamically-typed languages,
a gradual type system should support the language features that programmers
actually use.

This is why recent implementations of gradual typing have focused on
enabling object-oriented programming, since objects are widely used in nearly all
dynamically-typed languages in use today. Unfortunately, since different languages have
wildly different object systems, it's hard to compare research on gradual OO languages.
Ben Chung is working to address this by coming up with a formal model that
tries to unify various accounts of objects in order to better explain the design
tradeoffs. His goal is to cover the core ideas in Reticulated Python,
StrongScript, and Typed Racket.

Of course, dynamically-typed languages have a lot more than OO features. Along these
lines, I gave a talk on how at NU we're working to extend Typed Racket to cover
everything from objects (my thesis topic), first-class modules (Dan Feltey's
MS project), and higher-order contracts (Brian LaChance's MS project).

On the other side, as programs get more complex, programmers may wish to write
richer type specifications that provide even more guarantees. This makes gradual
typing a wide spectrum that goes from completely untyped, fully typed, and then beyond
to dependently typed. Andrew Kent and David Christiansen both presented work
that takes gradual typing beyond ordinary typed reasoning with dependent types.

Andrew presented an extension of Typed Racket that adds type refinements that can
check rich properties (like vector bounds) that are found in real Racket code
(see his RacketCon [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejFJIAsvdEg) and
recent [PLDI paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.07033.pdf)).
David Christiansen followed with a talk about adding dependent type theory to
Typed Racket, which would allow correct-by-construction programming using
a Nuprl-like proof system (he had a very cool GUI proof assistant demo in
his slides!).

## Performance

![](/img/2016-day-slide-8.png)

One of the key practical concerns about gradual typing is its performance overhead.
It's a concern because in order to ensure type safety, a gradually-typed language
implementation needs to install dynamic checks between the typed and untyped
parts of a program. This catches any inconsistencies between the typed interfaces
and how the untyped code may call into them.

Ben Greenman gave an upbeat talk that set the stage for this topic, pointing out
some key lessons that we've learned about performance from building Typed Racket.
The main idea he presented (also the topic of our [POPL 2016 paper](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/racket/pubs/popl16-tfgnvf.pdf))
is that to evaluate a gradual type system, you want to explore different ways
of adding types to a program and see how much it costs. This evaluation effort
started with Typed Racket, but he and Zeina Migeed are working on expanding it
to Reticulated Python.

From IU, Andre Kuhlenschmidt and Deyaaeldeen Almahallawi are exploring how
ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation strategies could help reduce the cost of gradual
typing. In particular, they are working on implementing [Schml](https://github.com/deyaaeldeen/Schml):
a compiler from the gradually-typed lambda calculus to C.

In addition to AOT compilation, the folks at IU are exploring tracing JIT compilation
as a means to make gradual typing faster. More specifically,
Spenser Bauman talked about Pycket, an alternative implementation of Racket that
uses RPython/PyPy to dramatically lower the overhead of gradual typing (also see the
[recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOfIY8NHAqg) of Spenser's
talk on the topic at RacketCon and his [ICFP paper](http://homes.soic.indiana.edu/samth/pycket-draft.pdf)).

## Usability

On the usability side, both Shriram Krishnamurthi and Ambrose Bonnaire-Sergeant
made observations on what it takes to get gradual typing in the hands of real
software developers.

Shriram approached the topic from the angle of CS education, which is the focus
of the [Pyret](http://www.pyret.org) language, and shared what the Brown language
group is working on. While Pyret doesn't exactly fit the mold of gradual typing,
it's a close cousin since it's a dynamically-typed language that explicitly takes
design cues from the best parts of statically-typed languages. That approach
lets CS beginners think in terms of types (the approach spearheaded by
[HtDP](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/index.html) and [Bootstrap](http://www.bootstrapworld.org/))
without having to battle a typechecker from the start.

For professional software developers, a major concern with gradual typing is that
writing type annotations may be a tedious and time intensive task. Ambrose, who
is the creator of Typed Clojure, shared some
preliminary work on how to cut down on the tedium by inferring gradual type
annotations by instrumenting programs for a dynamic analysis. The hope is to
be able to infer both recursive and polymorphic type annotations automatically
from tests (you may also be interested in Ambrose's
recent [ESOP paper](http://frenchy64.github.io/papers/esop16-short.pdf)
on Typed Clojure).

## Implementation Techniques

Finally, several talks focused on alternative implementation techniques for gradual
typing that provide a variety of software engineering benefits for implementers.

From Maryland, Brianna Ren gave a talk on Hummingbird, a just-in-time typechecker for Ruby programs
(also see the upcoming [PLDI paper](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~jfoster/papers/pldi16.pdf) by
Brianna and Jeff Foster).
The basic idea is that it's hard to implement a traditional static typechecker for a language that
heavily relies on metaprogramming, in which the fields/methods of classes
may be rewritten at run-time. This is particularly tricky for frameworks like Ruby on Rails.
Instead of checking types at compile-time, Hummingbird actually executes the typechecker
at run-time in order to be able to accurately check programs that use run-time metaprogramming.
To reduce overheads, she uses a cache for typechecking that is invalidated when classes are
modified.

Stephen Chang gave a very different view on metaprogramming in his talk, which focused on
_implementing_ typecheckers using metaprogramming (the [trivial](http://docs.racket-lang.org/trivial/index.html)
Typed Racket library is an offshoot of this work). His key idea is that typecheckers share
many aspects with macro-based metaprogramming systems, such as the need to traverse syntax
and annotate it with information. Since they share so much in common, why not just implement
the typechecker as a macro? Stephen demonstrates that not only is this possible, but that
it's possible to implement a wide variety of type system features this way including (local) type
inference. The connection to gradual typing is that even a gradual type system can be
implemented as a metaprogram by integrating the generation of dynamic checks into the macro
transformation process.

The last talk of the day (but certainly not the least), was by Michael Vitousek, who focused
on the _transient_ implementation of gradual typing (first described in his
[DLS paper](http://homes.soic.indiana.edu/mvitouse/papers/dls14.pdf)). Traditionally, gradual type systems
have implemented their dynamic checks using [proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_pattern)
objects that wrap method implementations with both pre- and post-checks. Unfortunately, this
implementation technique often conflicts with the underlying language. Since proxying changes
the identity of an object it can interfere with object equality tests. Instead, the transient
approach bakes the dynamic checks into and throughout the typed code to implement a "defense in depth"
against inconsistencies with untyped code. The great thing about this implementation
technique is that it doesn't demand any specialized support from the underlying language runtime
and is therefore easy to port to other languages (like JavaScript).

## Conclusion

Hopefully this blog post helps provide a better picture of the state
of gradual typing research. The exciting thing about gradual typing is that it contains
both interesting theoretical problems and also connects to the practical needs of
software developers.
