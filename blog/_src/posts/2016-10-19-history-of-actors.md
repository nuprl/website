Christos Dimoulas is currently teaching a
["History of Programming Languages" class at Harvard](http://www.seas.harvard.edu/courses/cs252/2016fa/).
The class is, as Christos writes, "definitely not about
[this](https://www.levenez.com/lang/lang_letter.pdf)"; instead, each
meeting is a deep examination of a single, mature research topic, in
terms of three to five key papers from the literature.

On Monday, I presented "the History of Actors" for the class. I've
made the written-out talk notes and an annotated bibliography
available [here](https://eighty-twenty.org/2016/10/18/actors-hopl).
