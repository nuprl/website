Max New, Daniel Patterson and Ben Greenman recently wrote three
two-page abstracts on what they are working on right now. Come have
a look -- and any feedback is welcome!

## Gradual Type Precision as Retraction

## Linking Types: Specifying Safe Interoperability and Equivalences

## Pruning Contracts with Rosette

## While we're at it let's rant on SRCs

These abstracts are submitted at POPL's "Student Research
Competition". You submit an abstract, and if you get accepted to that
thing, you get a bit of travel support money, and you have to prepare
a poster and present it at the conference.

I have a firm dislike for the *Competition* part of that concept:
I think that people think of research too competitively already, and
that we should have less of that, not more. (Having some is
unfortunately unavoidable in scarce-resource situations.) I think that
the process of awarding prizes to students with the "best poster" is
dumb -- and borderline ridiculous.

On the other hand, my experience seeing them writing these extended
abstracts is that it's a useful exercise for them, and produces nice
result -- short, readable introductions to their ideas. And Jennifer
Paykin [convincingly
argues](https://github.com/gasche/icfp2016-blog/blob/master/SVs/jennifer_paykin.md)
that although writing a poster is rather painful, actually presenting
it during the conference is interesting and useful. In her words,
"it's worth it to get the experience of authentic and fruitful
discussions". Plus having posters in the corridors of one's lab is very
nice.

I think we could have "Student Research Sessions" or "Student Poster
Sessions", where students are encouraged to present their work, would
write those nice extended abstracts and posters, interact with
researchers at the conference, and get travel money, without the
ranking and prize stuff. (I would still encourage students to
participate to SRC today, it seems to be worth it.)
