Over the past 50 years, which result from programming languages research
has had the greatest impact on working programmers?

<!-- more -->

The center of the universe for a working programmer is the language
(or languages) they use. Fundamental results in programming languages (PL)
research can re-shape this universe.

In [HOPL](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/7480-s17/index.html) two weeks ago,
Matthias claimed that _type soundness_ is the most useful
and influential result to flow from PL research to PL practice in the last 50
years.

But 50 years is a long time, and there are many serious contenders for the
title of _greatest PL result_. Here are my picks for the top 5:

### Abstraction
_thank you Peter Landin_


### Generational Garbage Collection
_thank you David Ungar_


### Type Soundness
_thank you Robin Milner_


### Modularization
_thank you D.L. Parnas_


### Generic Programming
_thank you Jean-Ives Girard and John C. Reynolds_
