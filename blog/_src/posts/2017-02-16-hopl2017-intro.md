This semester at Northeastern, Matthias Felleisen is organizing the
[History of Programming Languages](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/7480-s17/index.html)
seminar. Look for posts tagged `HOPL` for updates from the lectures.

Once every 6 to 8 years (i.e., once every batch of Ph.D. students?), [Matthias
Felleisen](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias) teaches History of Programming
Languages. Nominally, the course is a seminar. But unlike a typical seminar
course, weekly topics are not the technical details from a handful of papers.
Rather:

> The primary goal is to understand (some of) the discipline as it exists today
> and how some of its major themes evolved.

> The secondary goal is to develop basic skills for understanding and
> describing research themes. Every student will learn to study a theme via a
> series of papers, prepare an annotated bibliography, and present the key
> steps in the evolution of the theme.

**Themes** is the operative word. To set the tone, this semester started with
"themes that NUPRL faculty members have developed over the many decades of their
careers."

- Matthias, _Full Abstraction: From PCF to SPCF_
- Jan Vitek, _From Encapsulation to Ownership_
- Will Clinger, _Garbage Collection vs. Manual Allocation_
- Olin Shivers, _Higher-order Flow Analysis_
- Amal Ahmed, _Logical Relations: Stepping Beyond Toy Languages_
- Matthias, _Programming Languages and Calculi_
- Jan-Willem van de Meent, _Rescoring Strategies for Probabilistic Programs_
- (upcoming) Mitch Wand, _Analysis-Based Program Transformation_
- (upcoming) Frank Tip, _Refactoring_

At this point in the course, we are just starting with the student
presentations. As these presentations happen, we plan to push updates to this
blog. All presentation materials are in the course repository:

- [https://github.com/nuprl/hopl-s2017](https://github.com/nuprl/hopl-s2017)

Speakers' notes and annotated bibliographies are in top-level folders in the
repo. Discussion summaries and "unofficial" notes are in the top-level
[`lecture_notes/`](https://github.com/nuprl/hopl-s2017/tree/master/lecture_notes)
folder.

The list of upcoming presentations is online (along with
[the papers](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/7480-s17/Summary___Materials.html)
each presentation is based on):

- [http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/7480-s17/lectures.html](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/7480-s17/lectures.html)

Blogs posts for each talk should appear 2 weeks after the talk happens.
