> Talks can vary in length. Though 30-minute conference-style
> slots are traditional, speakers may request slots of as little

> permits the presentation of smaller results, preliminary work,
> progress reports on ongoing projects (such as language standards
> and compiler toolkits), and updates to past presentations. In
> general, NEPLS talks need not sound like conference
> presentations.
