I'm personally fond of such regional events, which is a great time to
learn about the research around us in a less formal and exhausting
setting than a 200-attendees conference.

If you are in the area, please consider applying to talk about your
work. If one of your colleague is working on something you find
exciting, please invite them to apply!
