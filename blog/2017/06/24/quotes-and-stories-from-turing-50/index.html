<p>The ACM recently hosted <a href="https://www.acm.org/turing-award-50">a celebration of 50 years of the A.M. Turing award</a>. These are some notes and thoughts from the event, including how Fred Brooks once rented a bus, Don Knuth&rsquo;s outrageous implementation of batch processing, and Judea Pearl&rsquo;s theory of homo sapiens.</p>

<h4 id="alan-turing-is-with-us-today"><em>Alan Turing is with us today</em></h4>

<p>At the start of the event, the <a href="http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/wh/">emcee</a> unveiled a bronze bust of Alan Turing. This statue was on display at center stage during the whole event.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a good sculpture and it&rsquo;s good we remember Alan Turing, but I&rsquo;m sad  that the ACM would encourage this kind of idol-worship. Let&rsquo;s not forget Turing&rsquo;s excellent teachers and colleagues!</p>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>the first awards recognized achievements in the standard fields of theory, AI, and systems</em></p>
 <p><em>hostile environment around the first awards, trepidation about future awards</em></p>
 <p><em>with Unix, Ritchie and Thompson got the design right</em></p>
 <p><em>Niklaus Wirth: &ldquo;If I understood how important Pcode was, I would have spent more time designing it&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote>

<h4 id="thoughts">thoughts</h4>

<p>What is &ldquo;systems&rdquo; &mdash; does that even have a definition? And Unix is definitely NOT an example of a &ldquo;right design&rdquo;; rather it&rsquo;s a  landmark of <a href="https://www.dreamsongs.com/WorseIsBetter.html">worse is better</a> design.</p>

<blockquote>
 <p> <em>I work in all areas of AI except for deep learning</em></p></blockquote>

<h4 id="judea-pearl">Judea Pearl</h4>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>I am a foreigner in this field &hellip; left because human beings are not good at handling information &hellip; people are very good with causal inference, not with statistical inference &hellip; deep learning is statistical</em></p>
 <p><em>there is a very old existence proof, homo sapiens took over the planet &hellip; I believe because they had an internal model of their environment &hellip; a drawing of a lion with wings is evidence of this model, you have  to have such a model before you can experiment with it and imagine &hellip; snakes have superb optics, result of a long  evolution process &hellip; very specific but they cannot build eyeglasses &hellip; humans have an internal model, can build a market based on promises  and build large communities based on promises</em></p>
 <p><em>I see four levels &hellip; second level is predicting events, if I do X then what? &hellip; third level is counterfactual, if I did things differently then how would the outcome change &hellip; very hard to advance between levels, are we working to help machine learning &lsquo;level up&rsquo;?</em></p>
 <p><em>data science is about the relation between data and reality &hellip; data alone is not data science</em></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="michael-jordan">Michael Jordan</h5>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>today we can&rsquo;t think without holding a piece of metal</em></p>
 <p><em>machine learning is part of computer science rather than AI &hellip; AI is about how to make human &hellip; machine learning is about allocating resources &hellip; matrices are not all of human intelligence &hellip; neural nets are part of a wider toolbox &hellip; too much hype in NLP its just syntax</em></p>
 <p><em>huge gap between syntax and semantics &hellip; chat bots are just syntax, don&rsquo;t learn &hellip; faking intelligence with neural nets, so well that you can build a company &hellip;</em></p>
 <p><em>real metric is task completion</em></p>
 <p><em>if I say &lsquo;a GLEEB walked across the airport&rsquo; then true intelligence can make a lot of educated guesses about a &lsquo;GLEEB&rsquo; without any other context</em></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="fei-fei-li">Fei-Fei Li</h5>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>I disagree, ML is part of AI &hellip; understanding intelligence and making intelligent methods for solving AI problems</em></p>
 <p><em>to quote Churchhill &lsquo;its not beginning of end, not end, not beginning of end, probably end of beginning&rsquo;</em></p>
 <p><em>todays AI powered by hardware and data</em></p>
 <p><em>AI cannot yet find our keys</em></p>
 <p><em>quote: &lsquo;todays AI is making a perfect chess move while the world is on fire&rsquo; &hellip; ignores context</em></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="stuart-russell">Stuart Russell</h5>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>Turing &hellip; a program is a mathematical object &hellip; math community did not recognize this</em></p>
 <p><em>lots of grad student descent &hellip; tuning to get performance &hellip; deep learning is neglecting the problem of exponential data &hellip; deep learning is just circuits, circuits lack expressive power &hellip; a human can process data from CERN but a neural net cannot, need to know physics</em></p>
 <p><em>probabilistic programming, somewhat under the radar, maybe on the right track &hellip; 10-line program running/generating/updating a large network of possibilities &hellip; more composable and flexible</em></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="ilya-sutskever">Ilya Sutskever</h5>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>why I like deep learning &hellip; philosophically satisfying &hellip; the hypothesis class is a circuit &hellip; powerful hypothesis class not too many parameters &hellip; can actually find circuits &hellip; &lsquo;violates all theory&rsquo; &hellip; really amazing &hellip; humans can see and hear pretty fast, even though our neurons are pretty slow, perhaps because we do a massively parallel process that doesn&rsquo;t take many steps &hellip; works well enough to be useful</em></p>
 <p><em>models e.g. for vision are very hard to understand &hellip; fight fire with fire &hellip; incomprehensible solution to incomprehensible problem</em></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="raquel-urtasun">Raquel Urtasun</h5>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>the breakthrough in neural nets is not algorithms &hellip; it is tricks, hardware, and grad students</em></p>
 <p><em>with neural nets we forget about modeling, uncertainty, and prior knowledge &hellip; perception is a canonical example</em></p></blockquote>

<h4 id="question-boundaries">question: boundaries</h4>

<h5 id="judea-pearl">Judea Pearl:</h5>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>glad to see people in deep learning understand its limitations &hellip; is there a clearer definition of the boundaries? Are you worried about bridging the levels factual/inferential/counterfactural?</em></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="michael-jordan">Michael Jordan</h5>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>the big problem is decision making under uncertainty</em></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="fei-fei-li">Fei-Fei Li</h5>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>cognition is a hard problem</em></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="judea-pearl">Judea Pearl</h5>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>do you have a clear idea of the boundaries?</em></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="michael-jordan">Michael Jordan</h5>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>neural nets use back-propagation &hellip; its non-modular, sad fact &hellip; performance and explainability is the tradeoff &hellip; then again people are non-modular</em></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="stuart-russell">Stuart Russell</h5>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>AlphaGo is not deep learning &hellip; basically an improved version of the machines Arthur Samuel made in the late 1950s &hellip; the interesting code is in C++ &hellip; rules of go, next moves, searching future states &hellip; depends on transitive closure</em></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="judea-pearl">Judea Pearl</h5>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>can AlphaGo take advice from a human?</em></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="michael-jordan">Michael Jordan</h5>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>not currently, but that would be a new policy to add to the toolbox &hellip; just as neural nets are one tool within AlphaGo</em></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="raquel-urtasun">Raquel Urtasun</h5>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>no reason to ask if deep learning is going to solve all problems</em></p></blockquote>

<h4 id="question-education">question: education?</h4>

<h5 id="judea-pearl">Judea Pearl</h5>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>indeed, what DO you teach in your neural networks classes?</em></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="fei-fei-li">Fei-Fei Li</h5>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>&hellip; chain rule, Taylor expansion</em></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="judea-pearl">Judea Pearl</h5>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>teaching is communicating truths &hellip; what is true about neural nets? what are some things that will definitely not happen?</em></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="stuart-russell">Stuart Russell</h5>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>Peter Norvig and I have a problem with our AI book &hellip; chapter on vision, chapter on speech, will probably post just point to the neural nets chapter &hellip; we don&rsquo;t really understand! &hellip; really selling students short</em></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="fei-fei-li">Fei-Fei Li</h5>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>in labs we talk about what we cannot do &hellip; we all have open problems</em></p>
 <p><em>Stuart I hope you have a very good author for the chapters. There are so many open problems to communicate to students!</em></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="michael-jordan">Michael Jordan</h5>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>CS cirriculum needs more statistics, inferential thinking &hellip; revise the whole cirriculum bottom-up to weave this in</em></p></blockquote>

<h4 id="question-could-a-neural-net-fix-my-phone-without-breaking-it">question: could a neural net fix my phone without breaking it?</h4>

<h5 id="judea-pearl">Judea Pearl</h5>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>right! big problem that neural nets have no internal model to manipulate</em></p></blockquote>

<h4 id="question-generalizability">question: generalizability?</h4>

<h5 id="ilya-sutskever">Ilya Sutskever</h5>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>special-purpose vs. general purpose solution depends on the problem &hellip; most things we give special-purpose solutions &hellip; I guess if you wanted to automate a mathematician that would need to be general</em></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="stuart-russell">Stuart Russell</h5>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>always argue with your self &hellip; try to break what you&rsquo;ve built &hellip; there&rsquo;s a system that plays video games just using the pixels on screen as hints &hellip; it&rsquo;s very good at mazes; if a newborn baby learned to play maze games in 2 hours that would be amazing! &hellip; does the system scale? absolutely not</em></p></blockquote>

<h4 id="thoughts">thoughts</h4>

<p>When Michael Jordan said &ldquo;people are non-modular&rdquo;, I think he means that people are able  to break abstraction barriers when needed.</p>

<h3 id="panel-restoring-personal-privacy-without-compromising-national-security">panel: Restoring Personal Privacy without Compromising National Security</h3>

<h5 id="joan-feigenbaum">Joan Feigenbaum</h5>

 <p><em>&hellip; wikileaks &hellip; russian hackers &hellip; social emergency &hellip;</em></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="whitfield-diffie">Whitfield Diffie</h5>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>everything I say today is copyleft</em></p>
 <p><em>its a misunderstanding to talk about a conflict between security and privacy &hellip; two aspects &hellip; problem goes back to feudalism &hellip; the right to build a castle was granted by the king &hellip; on one hand a castle improves national security &hellip; on the other hand a castle can be used to attack the king &hellip; technology is upsetting the basic notion of private vs. public security &hellip; governments cannot protect citizens and cannot protect themselves &hellip; extremely difficult to prove that a small process is secure</em></p>
 <p><em>exceptional access makes it more complex</em></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="paul-syverson">Paul Syverson</h5>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>major concern are national security threats and ability of authorities to confound threats &hellip; analogy to printing press &hellip; proclimation of 1635 that only state messengers can carry letters &hellip; 1663 treatise by the national censor, no printing house can have a back door &hellip; the general topic is very old &hellip; title of this session isn&rsquo;t very good, the real dilemma is investigation vs privacy</em></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="bryan-ford">Bryan Ford</h5>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>code is law for better or worse, tech is not a tool like a watch &hellip; tech can monitor us and decide when it works &hellip; tech is government, not obedient tools &hellip; the mind is a warrant-proof space &hellip; 5th amendment rights should extend to wearables</em></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="nadia-heninger">Nadia Heninger</h5>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>cannot divorce the security/privacy issues from the current political context &hellip; the serious vulnerabilities are not in math &hellip; they are in users and implementors</em></p></blockquote>

<h4 id="question-back-doors">question: back doors</h4>

<h5 id="joan-feigenbaum">Joan Feigenbaum</h5>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>perhaps we should explain what a back door is</em></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="bryan-ford">Bryan Ford</h5>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>agency keeps a master key in escrow</em></p>
 <p><em>non-lawyers can and should take a stand on basic issues</em></p>
 <p><em>there are legitimate warrant-proof spaces &hellip; electronic extensions of the mind need to be recognized as warrant-proof spaces</em></p>
 <p><em>the set of authorities with backdoor access should change as I travel between countries &hellip; but this will lead to a global race to the bottom</em></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="whitfield-diffie">Whitfield Diffie</h5>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>germany has a law against sex tourism (committed by German citizens visiting other countries) &hellip; neither government will be willing to lose backdoor access</em></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="nadia-heninger">Nadia Heninger</h5>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>technical reasons against backdoors &hellip; (1) &lsquo;weak crypto&rsquo; was implemented, nobody turned it off, is now breakable by anyone in 2015 &hellip; (2) Juniper used non-default crypto parameters, someone (inside?) changed the parameters &hellip; (3) attackers exploit back doors</em></p></blockquote>

<h5 id="bryan-ford">Bryan Ford</h5>

 <p><em>asking UNESCO to solve the problem is unrealistic &hellip; need to empower the fanatics, given them tools to preserve data</em></p></blockquote>

<h4 id="thoughts">thoughts</h4>

<p>I totally agree with the &ldquo;empower the fanatics&rdquo; sentiment. Today, because of &ldquo;volunteer librarians&rdquo;, I think we&rsquo;re doing pretty well about preserving  the past. Suppose I found an old PowerPoint file. I&rsquo;m sure I could find a way to read it with help from the internet &mdash; either  by searching Google, pirating an old version of PowerPoint, or asking online forums. So personally I&rsquo;m not worried about losing data we have currently; I&rsquo;m more  worried about the future, the internet becoming &ldquo;less chaotic&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The panel raised a good question about how to preserve research and encourage reproducibility. A <code>.pdf</code> or <code>.tex</code> document is not enough; a virtual machine is okay. Really I think we need a stronger cultural emphasis on literate programming  and a mature library like TeX to help authors store and share their work. <a href="https://thegamma.net/">The Gamma</a> seems on the right track.</p>

<p>I was surprised that the panel did not discuss search, version control, and  the ACM&rsquo;s open-access policy.</p>

<h3 id="panel-moores-law-is-really-dead-whats-next">panel: Moore&rsquo;s Law is Really Dead: What&rsquo;s Next?</h3>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>there&rsquo;s plenty of room at the top &hellip; with Moore&rsquo;s Law we got improvements at the bottom of the software stack, everything above got to benefit and it was easy to integrate the changes &hellip; there&rsquo;s lots of opportunities to trim fat in the middle/top of the software stack &hellip; these improvements will be harder to integrate, but there&rsquo;s lots of opportunities</em></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
 <p><em>important to distinguish approximate vs. precise software &hellip; precise software has a specification and the customer cares about that specification &hellip; approximate software doesn&rsquo;t have a hard spec, just needs to approximately work &hellip; the web is approximate, it doesn&rsquo;t work and it doesn&rsquo;t need to! &hellip; windows is precise, definitely has a spec and users definitely care</em></p></blockquote>

<h4 id="thoughts">thoughts</h4>

<p>The recording of this panel should be good; it was very lively, very practical. And the first audience question (by <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pattrsn/">David Patterson</a>) was &ldquo;an A+ question&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The panel reminded me of a talk by <a href="http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~patt/">Yale Patt</a>  about &ldquo;the end&rdquo; of the Von Neumann architecture. His opinion is future computers will be Von Neumann machines that rely  on &ldquo;accelerators&rdquo; like a GPU &mdash; computer organization is not going to change,  but will expand to have a bigger toolbox. So sure, Moore&rsquo;s Law is dead, but there are many opportunities to make  computers faster at places other than the bottom of the software stack.</p>

<p>I did not enjoy this panel. This is an ACM event, not a United Nations event. An ACM-sponsored panel about social and political problems should  look for constructive ways that computer science can address these problems. Raj Reddy tried to give constructive solutions, but the panel seemed more  interested in complaining about how hopeless things are.</p>

<p>The comment by Noel Sharkey about &ldquo;consider me as an individual&rdquo; was something  I hadn&rsquo;t thought about. Instead of worrying about biased datasets, let&rsquo;s use technology to  collect data on an individual instead of abstracting a person by their  race, age, or neighborhood.</p>

<h3 id="small-group-session">Small Group Session</h3>

<p>After the last panel, I got to attend a small group session with other students,  Dick Karp, and Don Knuth. It doesn&rsquo;t feel right to summarize or quote from the  session, but there&rsquo;s one thing I want to write about.</p>

<p>During the group session, I said something that I now regret. There was a brief silence as the group changed subjects, and someone suggested that we do a round of introductions. I objected, <em>this will take so long</em>,  but in fact the introductions were a very good idea.</p>

<p>Normally, I don&rsquo;t like introductions because they focus on names, backgrounds,  and credentials. I don&rsquo;t care about any of these when I&rsquo;m meeting someone! Rather, I prefer to just talk and by-the-way learn about the other person(s). There&rsquo;s an anaology to double-blind reviewing &mdash; the focus should be content  and not credentials.</p>

<p>These introductions were successful for two reasons. First, they gave everyone in the room a turn to speak, and this seemed  to help people join the actual discussion sooner. That was strange to me. I always feel a little nervous the first time I speak up in front  of a group, but if I really feel like speaking then I can always get over this  little barrier. I guess it&rsquo;s not right to assume the nervousness is &ldquo;little&rdquo; for everyone. Second, the introductions format was &ldquo;say your name and a funny fact&rdquo;. This prompt by itself led to some nice conversation topics:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Could a computer program decide whether a statement was funny or not funny?</li>
 <li>What kind of humor works in a classroom? In a textbook?</li>
 <li>Would this kind of introduction be acceptable in another era or culture,  for instance Victorian England?</li></ul>

<p>&ldquo;Nice&rdquo; in the sense that everyone could contribute, which was a real challenge. Even the question &ldquo;does anyone have a favorite algorithm?&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t have much  success fostering discussion.</p>

<p>Related: a useful greeting at the event was &ldquo;what SIG are you?&rdquo;. The answer was a good hint about what level of abstraction you two could best communicate at.</p>
