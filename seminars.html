                      <span> Modern verification techniques are becoming
                      ever-more powerful and sophisticated, and building
                      tools to implement them is a time-consuming and
                      difficult task. Writing a new verifier to validate
                      each on-paper approach is impractical; for this reason
                      intermediate verification languages such as Boogie and
                      Why3 have become popular over the last
                      decade. However, verification approaches geared around
                      complex program logics (such as separation logic) have
                      typically been implemented in specialised tools, since
                      the reasoning is hard to map down to first-order
                      automated reasoning. In practice, this means that a
                      rich variety of modern techniques have no
                      corresponding tool support.  In this talk, I will
                      present the new Silver intermediate verification
                      language, which has been designed to facilitate the
                      lightweight implementation of a variety of modern
                      methodologies for program verification. In contrast to
                      lower-level verification languages, Silver provides
                      native support for heap reasoning; modes of reasoning
                      such as concurrent separation logic, dynamic frames
                      and rely-guarantee/invariants can be simply encoded.
                      Silver has been developed as part of the Viper
                      project, which provides two automated back-end
                      verifiers for Silver programs. Since releasing our
                      software in September last year, it has been used for
                      (internal and external) projects to build tools for
                      Java verification, non-blocking concurrency reasoning,
                      flow-sensitive typing and reasoning about GPU and
                      Linux kernel code.

                      <span>In this talk, I will first present a method and
                        a tool TARA for generating succinct representations
                        of sets of concurrent traces. In our work, we focus
                        on trace sets that contain all correct or all
                        incorrect permutations of events from a given
                        trace. We represent such trace sets as Boolean
                        combinations of happens-before ordering constraints
                        between events.  Our trace set representations can
                        drive diverse verification, fault localization,
                        repair, and synthesis techniques for concurrent
                        programs. In the remainder of the talk, I will focus
                        on the use of our representation for synchronization
                        synthesis.  This work appears in POPL 2015 and CAV
                        2015, and is joint work with Pavol Cerny, Ed Clarke,
                        Ashutosh Gupta, Tom Henzinger, Arjun Radhakrishna,
                        Leonid Ryzhyk and Thorsten Tarrach.

		<h2>Programming Language Seminar, Junior</h2>	
		<p>The junior PL seminar (<a href="http://lists.ccs.neu.edu/pipermail/pl-sem-jr">mailing list</a>) (<a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/stamourv/pljr.html">home page</a>): a regular student-only seminar, suitable for those new to the study of programming languages.
		  <br>
		  <p>The PL Seminar, Jr. is a seminar where students new to the area can discuss the study of programming languages. This seminar is not intended to replace the main PL Seminar, but we hope that it can augment that by providing a place where junior students can discuss topics and ask questions at a pace better suited to our level of knowledge. Topics include:
		  <ul>
		    <li>Design and analysis of programming languages: syntax, semantics, pragmatics (ie, how do you use a language feature in real programs?)</li>
		    <li>Implementation of programming languages</li>
		    <li>Program development, both large and small</li>
		    <li>Programming pedagogy</li>
		    <li>Programming tools and environments</li>
		    <li>and anything else that catches our interest.</li>
		  </ul>
		  We will not restrict ourselves to current research. Indeed, we intend to focus on older papers, textbook chapters, and surveys.
		  </p>
		  <br>
		  <h4>Why PL Seminar, Jr.?</h4>
		  <small>
		    <p>In many ways, the existing PL Seminar doesn't serve junior students well. For us, it is intended to provide an environment where we can go to listen to current research. While nobody expects us to understand the entire presentation, we would ideally be able to say, "I didn't understand that, but it sounded really neat." By and large, that hasn't happened, for a number of reasons:
		      <ul>
			<li>For many of us, once our level of comprehension drops below a certain threshold, we tend to get frustrated and tune out. It's very difficult to say that something sounds interesting when you don't even feel like you understand the language.</li>
			<li>The discussion environment isn't really helpful to junior students. The questions from the audience are typically research-oriented; often, a great deal of background knowledge is required to follow the ensuing discussions.</li>
			<li>To overuse a metaphor, the bandwidth available for discussion tends to be filled by a relatively small number of people; it's often difficult for a junior student to get a word in edgewise.</li>
		      </ul>
		    <p></small>
		  <br>
		  <h4>Seminar Culture</h4>

		  <small><p>For this seminar to be as useful as possible, it is important we establish the right "seminar culture." This is, of course, something that is hard to describe, and it will shift and evolve. However, there are some guidelines for what we are trying to accomplish:
		      <ul>
			<li>Attendees are willing to learn and to help others learn. They should not come in order to demonstrate how much smarter they are than everyone else just because they know so much more about a specific topic.</li>
			<li>Active listening is encouraged. Ask questions! In particular, while research questions are of course welcome, basic comprehension questions are especially encouraged. If you don't understand something, or if you don't believe a step in a proof, ask!</li>
			<li>An important corollary: no question is too stupid to ask. This places an obligation on other members of the seminar: rather than express frustration at the basic nature of a question, look at it as an opportunity to practice your skills in explaining things.</li>
			<li>Of course, while active listening is a good thing, we want to avoid having a few people fill the communications channel. So, please be considerate of the other people present and allow them to join the discussions as well.</li>
		      </ul>
		    <p>Any attendee may propose a topic; we'll solicit volunteers to present a survey of the area. We expect that most of the presenters will be junior PL students, although outside presentations are welcome.</p></small>
