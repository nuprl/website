<div class="pn-abstract-bio"><p class="pn-title-2">Abstract</p>
<p>Shared session types generalize the Curry-Howard correspondence between intuitionistic linear logic and the session-typed pi-calculus with adjoint modalities that mediate between linear and shared session types, giving rise to a programming model where shared channels must be used according to an acquire-release discipline.  The resulting language recovers the expressiveness of the untyped asynchronous pi-calculus and accommodates practical programming scenarios, such as shared servers, file systems etc.  The resulting language is implemented as a prototype in C0 (a safe subset for C used to teach freshmen at CMU) and <a href="https://github.com/maybevoid/ferrite">as a DSL in Rust</a>.</p>
<p>The generalization, however, comes at the cost of deadlock-freedom, a property which holds for the purely linear fragment.  In this talk, I report on recent work that makes up for this deficiency and introduces a type system of linear and shared session types in which the adjoint modalities are complemented with possible worlds to rule out cyclic dependencies between acquires and synchronizations.  I distill the key abstractions to reason about cyclic dependencies and the key invariants enforced by the type system to guarantee deadlock-freedom.  Time permitted, I report on ongoing work that also uses possible world modalities for type-based verification of program properties of interest.</p>

<div class="pn-abstract-bio"><p class="pn-title-2">Abstract</p>
<p>This talk tells the rather uncommon story of the co-evolution of my company, Raincode, with a home-grown programming language, YAFL. The two are intimately intertwined: Raincode would crumble if YAFL was to disappear, and YAFL would have no reason to exist if Raincode was to stop its activities. YAFL is a strongly-typed object-oriented language originally designed and implemented a quarter of century ago. Our story starts with YAFL’s inception, its design, our motivations (including the usual fantasies of  world domination) and the technical underpinnings and some key implementation decisions.</p>
<p>Our story is rooted in the real-world where pragmatics reign. I will argue that out design choices and implementation decisions have converged to give YAFL its true value, and, that the fruits of growing our own language are well worth the maintenance burden. The talk will argue that YAFL is a non-DSL, and touch on the good ideas as well as the lousy ones. I will discuss how to evolve a language over time by judiciously adding, as well as removing, features. Above all, it is story about people. The language designer, its implementors, its first users, even its customers are the main. Their interplay sheds a light on how languages are created and maintained.</p>

<p>Automatic differentiation (AD) is the science of efficiently computing the derivative (or gradient, or Jacobian) of functions specified by computer programs. It is a fundamental tool in several fields, most notably machine learning, where it is the key for training deep neural networks. Albeit AD techniques natively focus on a restricted class of programs, namely first-order straight-line programs, the rise of so-called differentiable programming in recent years has urged for the need of applying AD to complex programs, endowed with control flow operators and higher-order combinators, such as map and fold. In this talk, I will discuss the extension of AD algorithms to PCF, a(n idealized) purely functional programming language. We will first consider the simply-typed lambda-calculus, showing in particular how linear negation is related to reverse-mode AD (a.k.a., backpropagation), and then see how the extra features of PCF, namely full recursion and conditionals, may be dealt with, stressing the difficulties posed by the latter.</p>

<p>In this talk, I will give a high-level overview of CertiCoq, a verified compiler from Coq to C, focusing on my research on CertiCoq's backend. The backend of CertiCoq is based on a micro-pass compiler architecture: each stage in its pipeline performs a simple task, yet they combine to generate efficient code. The micro-pass design along with our proof framework based on logical relations greatly facilities modular reasoning and proof reuse. Furthermore, I will show how this logical relation framework can be extended to provide correctness guarantees for programs compiled separately with CertiCoq, using perhaps different sets of optimizations. Lastly, I will discuss future research directions with CertiCoq, such as provably correct interoperation of Coq and C using the Verified Software Toolchain.</p>

<div class="pn-abstract-bio"><p class="pn-title-2">Abstract</p>
<p>Serverless computing is a cloud computing abstraction that makes it easier to write robust, large-scale web services. In serverless computing, programmers write what are called serverless functions, and the cloud platform transparently manages the operating system, resource allocation, load-balancing, and fault tolerance. When demand spikes, the platform automatically allocates additional hardware and manages load-balancing; when demand falls, the platform silently deallocates idle resources; and when the platform detects a failure, it transparently retries affected requests.</p>
<p>In this talk, we will see how language-based techniques can make serverless computing faster, safer, and cheaper for programmers. First, we present a detailed, operational model of a serverless computing platform, which shows that serverless computing is a leaky abstraction. We then derive a less-leaky &quot;naive semantics&quot; and precisely characterize how the two semantics coincide. Second, we extend the operational semantics with a domain-specific language for composing serverless functions, and show that the language design lends itself to an efficient implementation that lowers the cost of building modular applications. Finally, we present a &quot;serverless function accelerator&quot; that significantly reduces the latency of a large class of functions using language-based sandboxing and speculative optimizations.</p>

<div class="pn-abstract-bio"><p class="pn-title-2">Abstract</p>
<p>Rust is a young and actively developed &quot;systems programming language&quot; that promises to overcome the seemingly fundamental tradeoff between high-level safety guarantees and low-level control over resource management. This talk is about my research on understanding and evolving this groundbreaking new language.</p>
<p>The first part of the talk is about building formal foundations for the existing Rust language. Rust employs a strong, ownership-based type system to rule out common systems programming anomalies, but then extends the expressive power of this core type system through libraries that internally use unsafe features. Unfortunately, this ``extensible'' aspect of the Rust language makes Rust's safety claims rather non-obvious, and there is good reason to question whether they actually hold. To address this, we have developed RustBelt, the first formal (and machine-checked) safety proof for a language representing a realistic subset of Rust. Our proof supports the extensible nature of Rust's safety story in the sense that, for each new Rust library that uses unsafe features, we can say what verification condition it must satisfy in order for it to be deemed a safe and compositional extension to the language.</p>
<p>The second part is about evolving the semantics of Rust to better support compiler optimizations. In particular, Rust's reference types provide strong aliasing guarantees, which a clever optimizing compiler should be able to exploit.  However, if no care is taken, unsafe code (which plays an essential role in the Rust ecosystem, as mentioned above) can subvert these guarantees. To address this, we have developed Stacked Borrows, a new operational semantics for memory accesses in Rust. On the one hand, Stacked Borrows defines an aliasing discipline and declares programs violating it to have undefined behavior, thus making it possible for us to formally verify the soundness of a number of useful type-based intraprocedural optimizations. On the other hand, we have also implemented the Stacked Borrows semantics in Miri, an interpreter for Rust, and run large parts of the Rust standard library test suite in Miri. In so doing, we have validated that our semantics is sufficiently permissive to account for real-world unsafe Rust code.</p>

<div class="pn-abstract-bio"><p class="pn-title-2">Abstract</p>
<p>Nom demonstrated that efficient and well-behaved gradual typing is possible. But it did so by assuming all code was written using nominal patterns in a simplistic type system. The nominal patterns limit the applicability to existing untyped code, and the simplistic type system limits the applicability to modern industry languages. This talk will present recent results addressing both of these limitations. I will illustrate an implemented design that enables structural patterns to mix with nominal patterns while also providing a variant of the gradual guarantee that ensures interoperability between these patterns and a semantics-preserving migration path from structural patterns into nominal patterns. I will further demonstrate that Nom's design strategy scales to parametric polymorphism, where the key challenge is not actually generic classes or interfaces but rather generic methods and type-argument inference. Although preliminary, experiments suggest that these more expressive designs can still be implemented relatively efficiently, altogether indicating that gradual typing is a viable feature for nominal languages.</p>

<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential for being the next industrial revolution, envisioning billions of embedded devices. Because of their limited resources, IoT devices present specific challenges to their programming and deployment. For instance, limited battery lifetime imposes extreme energy-savings efforts, and low RAM and CPU processing power not only restrict computation power but can also lead to unexpected runtime errors (e.g, out of memory).</p><p>C and C++ languages are often preferred when programming these devices. These languages deliver good performance but are notoriously unsafe and ill-suitable for proving high-level properties specific to HW usage (e.g., sending a message only when Wi-Fi module is connected). Invalid program behaviors can lead to silent errors and energy wasting, resulting in the high-cost of reprogramming thousands of devices.</p><p>In this presentation, I will introduce Pekoe, a language for programming IoT devices that can determine, at compile time, the correct usage of hardware components. Pekoe introduces Harel Statecharts as types to model the hardware behavior. The compiler checks every possible execution trace of a program against the hardware model (the type) thus ensuring the correct order of system calls (e.g., sending a message via Wi-Fi, or suspending the CPU).</p>

<div class="pn-abstract-bio"><p class="pn-title-2">Abstract</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a lot of research on shared-memory concurrency. Nevertheless, programmers are discouraged from using it because of the difficulty of writing clear, correct programs. This is embodied for example in the Go Language slogan “Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating.” But do we have the right abstractions for message-passing concurrent programming? I argue that we do not (yet!) because concurrency constructs are usually bolted on to an existing language with an entirely different semantic foundation. I will review some recent progress on designing better abstractions based on strong logical and type-theoretic principles. Multiple themes from functional and object-oriented programming will re-emerge from these foundations in a new form, including (ha!) shared memory.</p>

<p>The scale and pervasiveness of modern software poses a challenge for programmers: software reliability is more important than ever, but the complexity of computer systems continues to grow. Automated programming tools are powerful weapons for programmers to tackle this challenge: verifiers that check software correctness, and synthesizers that generate new correct-by-construction programs. These tools are most effective when they apply domain-specific optimizations, but doing so today requires considerable formal methods expertise. In this talk, I present a new application-driven approach to optimizing the automated programming stack underpinning modern domain-specific tools. I will demonstrate the importance of programming tools in the context of memory consistency models, which define the behavior of multiprocessor CPUs and whose subtleties often elude even experts. Our new tool, MemSynth, automatically synthesizes formal descriptions of memory consistency models from examples of CPU behavior. We have used MemSynth to synthesize descriptions of the x86 and PowerPC memory models, each of which previously required person-years of effort to describe by hand, and found several ambiguities and underspecifications in both architectures. I will then present symbolic profiling, a new technique we designed and implemented to help people identify the scalability bottlenecks in automated programming tools. These tools use symbolic evaluation, which evaluates all paths through a program, and is an execution model that defies both human intuition and standard profiling techniques. Symbolic profiling diagnoses scalability bottlenecks using a novel performance model for symbolic evaluation that accounts for all-paths execution. We have used symbolic profiling to find and fix performance issues in 8 state-of-the-art automated tools, improving their scalability by orders of magnitude, and our techniques have been adopted in industry. Finally, I will give a sense of the importance of future application-driven optimizations to the automated programming stack, with applications that inspire improvements to the stack and in turn beget even more powerful automated tools.</p>

<p>Constant-time programming is an established discipline to secure programs against timing attackers. Several real-world secure C libraries such as NaCl, mbedTLS, or Open Quantum Safe, follow this discipline. We propose two advanced compile-time verification techniques to enforce this discipline. The first one operates at assembly level with help from alias informations that are computed at source level and transmitted by the compiler. The second one operates at source level, using advanced abstract interpretation techniques. For this last approach, we also study how to ensure that the compiler will not break the property during compilation. These techniques have been implemented in the CompCert compiler toolchain and tested on several crypto libraries. These works have been presented at CCS’14, CSF’17 and ESORICS’17.</p>

<p>The precision of heap analyses determines the precision of several associated optimizations, and has been a prominent area in compiler research. It has been shown that context-sensitive heap analyses are more precise than the insensitive ones, but their scalability continues to be a cause of concern. Though the value-contexts approach improves the scalability of classical call-string based context-sensitive analyses, it still does not scale well for several popular whole-program heap analyses. In this talk, I will discuss our three-staged approach that lets us scale complex whole-program value-contexts based heap analyses for large programs. The ideas involved are based on an important observation that we do not need to compare the complete value-contexts at each call-site. Apart from this, I will also give an overview of another work, named PYE (for &quot;precise-yet-efficient”). PYE helps obtain precise results during just-in-time compilation efficiently, by splitting the work between the static Java compiler and the C2 compiler of the HotSpot JVM.</p>

<p>For ARMv8 and RISC-V, there are concurrency models in two styles, extensionally equivalent: axiomatic models, expressing the concurrency semantics in terms of global properties of complete executions; and operational models, that compute incrementally. The latter are in an abstract micro-architectural style: they execute each instruction in multiple steps, out-of-order and with explicit branch speculation. This similarity to hardware implementations has been important in developing the models and in establishing confidence, but involves complexity that, for programming and model-checking, one would prefer to avoid. In this talk, I will present new more abstract operational models for ARMv8 and RISC-V, and an exploration tool based on them. The models compute the allowed concurrency behaviours incrementally based on thread-local conditions and are significantly simpler than the existing operational models: executing instructions in a single step and (with the exception of early writes) in program order, and without branch speculation. We prove the models equivalent to the existing ARMv8 and RISC-V axiomatic models in Coq. The exploration tool is the first such tool for ARMv8 and RISC-V fast enough for exhaustively checking the concurrency behaviour of a number of interesting examples. We demonstrate using the tool for checking several standard concurrent datastructure and lock implementations such as Michael-Scott queue and Chase-Lev deque, compiled from C++ and Rust with GCC or Clang -O3, and for interactively stepping through model-allowed executions for debugging.</p>

<p>Identifying relationships among program elements is useful for program understanding, debugging, and analysis. One such kind of relationship is synonymy. Function synonyms are functions that play a similar role in code; examples include functions that perform initialization for different device drivers, and functions that implement different symmetric-key encryption schemes. Function synonyms are not necessarily semantically equivalent and can be syntactically dissimilar; consequently, approaches for identifying code clones or functional equivalence cannot be used to identify them. In this talk I will present our recent work Func2vec, a technique that learns an embedding that maps each function to a vector in a continuous vector space such that vectors for function synonyms are in close proximity. We compute the function embedding by training a neural network on sentences generated using random walks over the interprocedural control-flow graph. We show the effectiveness of Func2vec at identifying function synonyms in the Linux kernel, and its applicability to the problem of mining error-handling specifications in Linux file systems and drivers.</p>

<p>Until now, CPU designers and computer scientists have assumed Vegas rules at the hardware level: what happens in speculation stays in speculation. Yet in the wake of the Spectre and Meltdown attacks, it has become clear a new, massive class of security vulnerabilities awaits us at the microarchitectural level because this assumption is simply false. As language designers and implementors familiar with building towers of abstractions, we have assumed that virtualization through emulation made the worlds below the Turing machine undetectable, hidden behind a mathematically perfect mirror. This talk will explore how we have now learned to see through that mirror, into the very bizarre and alien world of microarchitectures, illuminating a tiny world of astounding complexity that holds profound implications for language security.</p>

<p>Modern service-oriented applications forgo semantically rich protocols and middleware when composing services. Instead, they embrace the loosely-coupled development and deployment of services that communicate via simple network protocols. Even though these applications do expose interfaces that are higher-order in spirit, the simplicity of the network protocols forces them to rely on brittle low-level encodings. To bridge the apparent semantic gap, programmers introduce ad-hoc and error-prone defensive code. Inspired by Design by Contract, we choose a different route to bridge this gap. We introduce Whip, a contract system for modern services. Whip (i) provides programmers with a higher-order contract language tailored to the needs of modern services; and (ii) monitors services at run time to detect services that do not live up to their advertised interfaces. Contract monitoring is local to a service. Services are treated as black boxes, allowing heterogeneous implementation languages without modification to services' code. Thus, Whip does not disturb the loosely coupled nature of modern services.</p>

<p>Programming languages differ a lot in the ways of their development. Who is responsible for including new features and removing obsolete ones? What is a process of doing that? Is there any more or less formal language definition? How respected is that definition by the compilers? How is this changed if there is only one compiler? These questions are answered quite differently for various programming languages. Haskell takes its own way which was crystallized relatively recently. We have GHC Proposals in the form of the GitHub pull requests to suggest new language features. We also have the GHC Steering Committee with its own process to either accept or reject proposals. Finally, there is the Haskell 2020 Language (Haskell Prime) Committee with its own problem of being effectively dead. In this talk, I’d like to describe how this system works for Haskell and why it doesn’t work sometimes. I will discuss the most recent examples of transforming Haskell kinds system towards dependent types (started before the GHC Steering Committee was formed) and introducing linear types in Haskell (subject to the full-blown Committee discussion) among others. I will also characterize the current state and perspectives of the Haskell standardization process.</p>

As coined by Philip Wadler in 1998, EP is a new name for an old problem. Given a data type defined by cases, consider two independent extensions, namely, adding new cases to the data type and new functions over the datatype. Dozens of papers in the research literature present their solutions to the EP, using a variety of programming languages and approaches. In this talk I present a Scala-based framework that can synthesize full solutions to the EP problem. The first step is to model the domain of interest (such as mathematical expressions or geometric shapes) to ensure that our synthesized code can work with any desired application domain. Second, we demonstrate how to synthesize code that reproduces a dozen EP solutions from the literature, in C++, Java and Haskell. We designed a common API for all approaches, independent of programming language. While we do not introduce any new approach for EP, we explore the challenges that EP solutions face with binary methods and producer methods. An important contribution of this work is the scientific reproduction of known solutions from the literature.

<p>The Parfait static code analysis tool focuses on detecting vulnerabilities that matter in C, C++, Java and PL/SQL languages. Its focus has been on key items expected out of a commercial tool that lives in a commercial organization, namely, precision of results (i.e., high true positive rate), scalability (i.e., being able to run quickly over millions of lines of code), incremental analysis (i.e., being able to run over deltas of the code quickly), and usability (i.e., ease of integration into standard build processes, reporting of traces to the vulnerable location, etc). Today, Parfait is used by thousands of developers at Oracle worldwide on a day-to-day basis. In this presentation we’ll sample a flavour of Parfait — we explore some real world challenges faced in the creation of a robust vulnerability detection tool, look into two examples of vulnerabilities that severely affected the Java platform in 2012/2013 and most machines in 2017/2018, and conclude by recounting what matters to developers for integration into today’s continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.</p>

<p>Computational effects, such as mutable state, memory allocation, non-determinism, and I/O interaction, allow programs to implicitly exhibit complex behaviour. I will discuss three abstractions that allow programmers to extend a language with user-defined effects. Control operators (call-cc, shift/reset, etc.)  are a well-established abstraction for user-defined effects, and I will consider the specific shift/dollar without answer-type-modification. Since the 90s, functional languages have used monads for user-defined effects, and I will consider Filinski's monadic reflection. In the last decade, the community started looking into Plotkin and Pretnar's handlers for algebraic effects (extensible effects in Haskell, OCaml multicore, the Eff, Frank, Koka, and Links programming languages) as a programming abstraction, and I will consider deep handlers without forwarding. I will compare the relative expressive power of these three abstractions using Felleisen's notion of macro-translations.  This comparison demonstrates the sensitivity of relative expressiveness of user-defined effects to seemingly orthogonal language features. This talk is based on the paper: On the expressive power of user-defined effects: effect handlers,monadic reflection, delimited control. Yannick Forster, Ohad Kammar, Sam Lindley, and Matija Pretnar.

We construct a series of example attacks that illustrate how garbage collectors form a shared resource that can be used to reliably leak sensitive information at a rate of up to 1 byte/sec on a contemporary general-purpose computer. The created channel is also observable across a network connection in a datacenter-like setting. We subsequently present a design of an automatic memory management system and prove that the presented attacks are impossible on garbage collectors satisfying this design.

<p>Type systems and syntactic sugar are both valuable to programmers, but sometimes at odds. While sugar is a valuable mechanism for implementing realistic languages, the expansion process obscures program source structure. As a result, type errors can reference terms the programmers did not write (and even constructs they do not know), baffling them. The language developer must also manually construct type rules for the sugars, to give a typed account of the surface language. We address these problems by presenting a process for automatically reconstructing type rules for the surface language using rules for the core. We have implemented this theory, and show several interesting case studies.</p>

<p>The spectacular results achieved by computer science in the recent years rely on hidden, obscure, and badly specified components that lurk at the very heart of our computing infrastructure. Consider DWARF debug information. Debug information is relied upon by debuggers and plays a key role in the in the implementation of program analysis tools. More surprisingly, debug information can be relied upon by the runtime of high-level programming languages, for instance by C++ to unwind the stack and implement exceptions. The debug information itself can be pervaded by subtle bugs, making the whole infrastructure unreliable. In this talk I will describe techniques and tools to perform validation and synthesis of the DWARF stack unwinding tables. I will also report on adventurous projects that we might build on top of reliable DWARF information.</p>

<p>I will present Call-by-name (CBN) Gradual Type Theory [1], an axiomatic semantics of CBN gradual typing that directly axiomatizes the extensionality (eta) principles of types and the &quot;gradual guarantee&quot; of [2]. By axiomatizing the &quot;term precision&quot; relation of [2] we can provide a specification for casts as meets and joins with respect to precision. Using our type theory, we then show that the classic function contract ([3]) is in fact the unique implementation of function casts that satisfies extensionality and the gradual guarantee. This shows that the combination of these properties is a very strong constraint on the design of a gradually typed language and any implementation that departs must sacrifice one of these properties (typically extensionality).</p><p>[1] Call-by-Name Gradual Type Theory, New and Licata, to appear FSCD '18,https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00061</p><p>[2] Refined Criteria for Gradual Typing, Siek, Vitousek, Cimini and Boyland, SNAPL '15, http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2015/5031/</p><p>[3] Contracts for Higher-Order Functions, Findler and Felleisen, ICFP '02,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=581484</p>

By now, a large number of techniques exist for simulating creativity, such as search, planning, production grammars, logic programming, stochastic modeling from data, and hybrid approaches. However, even the simplest methods are commonly considered programming tasks for &quot;AI experts.&quot; High-level programming languages have the potential to broaden participation in authorship of these systems, but only if they are designed with compositionality -- the mathematical principle that's also functional programming's secret weapon -- in mind.

<p>Gradual Typing is the idea that we can support both static and dynamic type checking in different parts of the same program in the same language. Most existing work on gradual typing aims to add gradual typing to an existing language. However, this severely constrains some key decisions in creating gradually typed languages, often leading designers to trade off either soundness or efficiency.</p>
<p>I will talk about designing a nominal object-oriented language with gradual typing as a core component from the start. This affects key design decisions for the other type system features, as well as the design of the runtime. Experiments with a prototype language I implemented suggest that this is a viable approach to achieve sound, yet efficient gradual typing. I will present those results and talk about some key design challenges that have yet to be solved.</p>

<p>Deep learning is formulated around backpropagation, a method for computing gradients of a particular class of data flow graphs to train models to minimize error by gradient descent.  Backpropagation is a special case of a more general method known as reverse mode automatic differentiation (AD) for computing gradients of functions expressed as programs.  Reverse mode AD imposes only a small constant-factor overhead in operation count over the original computation, but has storage requirements that grow, in the worst case, in proportion to the time consumed by the original computation.  This storage blowup can be ameliorated by check pointing, a process that reorders application of classical reverse-mode AD over an execution interval to tradeoff space vs. time.  Application of check pointing in a divide-and-conquer fashion to strategically chosen nested execution intervals can break classical reverse-mode AD into stages which can reduce the worst-case growth in storage from linear to logarithmic.  Doing this has been fully automated only for computations of particularly simple form, with checkpoints spanning execution intervals resulting from a limited set of program constructs.  We show how the technique can be automated for arbitrary computations.  Doing so relies on implementing general purpose mechanisms for counting the number of instructions executed by a program, interrupting the execution after a specified number of steps, and resuming the execution with a nonstandard interpretation.  We implement these general purpose mechanisms with a compiler that converts programs to continuation-passing style (CPS).  The process of efficiently computing gradients with check pointing requires running, and rerunning, little bits of the program out of order.  This is made easier by applying the technique to functional programs. There is a deeper and higher-level message in this talk: machine learning can benefit from advanced techniques from programming language theory.</p>

<p>The polymorphic blame calculus integrates static typing, including universal types, with dynamic typing. The primary challenge with this integration is preserving parametricity: even dynamically-typed code should satisfy it once it has been cast to a universal type. Ahmed et al. (2011) employ runtime type generation in the polymorphic blame calculus to preserve parametricity, but a proof that it does so has been elusive. Matthews and Ahmed (2008) gave a proof of parametricity for a closely related system that combines ML and Scheme, but later found a flaw in their proof. In this work we prove that the polymorphic blame calculus satisfies relational parametricity. The proof relies on a step-indexed Kripke logical relation. The step-indexing is required to make the logical relation well-defined in the case for the dynamic type. The possible worlds include the mapping of generated type names to their concrete types and the mapping of type names to relations. We prove the Fundamental Property of this logical relation and that it is sound with respect to contextual equivalence.</p>

<p>Contract-based software development is a leading methodology for the construction of safety- and mission-critical embedded systems. Contracts are an effective way to establish boundaries between components and can be used efficiently to verify global properties by using compositional reasoning techniques. A contract specifies the assumptions a component makes on its context and the guarantees it provides. Requirements in the specification of a component are often case-based, with each case describing what the component should do depending on a specific situation (or mode) the component is in.</p><p>This talk introduces CoCoSpec, a mode-aware assume-guarantee-based contract language for embedded systems. CoCoSpec is built as an extension of the Lustre language and lets users specify mode behavior directly, instead of encoding it as conditional guarantees, thus preventing a loss of mode-specific information. Mode-aware model checkers supporting CoCoSpec can increase the effectiveness of the compositional analysis techniques found in assume-guarantee frameworks and improve scalability. Such tools can also produce much better feedback during the verification process, as well as valuable qualitative information on the contract itself. I will presents the CoCoSpec language and illustrate the benefits of mode-aware model-checking on a case study involving a flight-critical avionics system. The evaluation uses Kind 2, a collaborative, parallel, SMT-based model checker developed at the University of Iowa that provides full support for CoCoSpec.</p>

<p>Programming language research keeps inventing more powerful dynamic and static features for programming language. Ideally, thorough language design should be able to propose a single, unified, powerful yet simple view of them as orthogonal aspects of a single programming language that would remain usable by everyone. In practice, it always takes much more time and effort to find the simple/orthogonal presentation than to come up with the desirable features, and we become emotionally attached to programming language monoliths (C++, Scala, GHC Haskell, OCaml, Common Lisp...) that suffer from feature creep. An alternative is to design programming systems as multi-language environment instead. This point of view makes it easier to detect flaws in a proposed programming system design: there is no clear objective definition of what &quot;orthogonal features&quot; really mean, but we have clear ideas of how multi-language systems should work. The Racket Manifesto says: &quot;Each language and component must be able to protect its specific invariants&quot;.</p><p>In this work we give a formal specification, in terms of full abstraction, for what it means for a new language added to the system to not introduce &quot;abstraction leaks&quot; in the other languages, and discuss scenarios where this translates in (informal) usability properties: having a nice teachable language subset, or gracefully introducing an advanced language for experts. We present a multi-language design that exhibits this formal property by adding a language L with linear types and linear state to a typical ML-style programming language U. L allows to write programs with resource usage guarantees (space consumption, typestate-style safety guarantees) that were not possible in U, without introducing abstraction leaks. We will demonstrate several useful examples, some of them that crucially rely on the fine-grained use of language boundaries, at a subterm level rather than whole-module level.</p>

<p>We present FLIX, a declarative programming language for specifying and solving least fixed point problems, particularly static program analyses. FLIX is inspired by Datalog and extends it with lattices and monotone functions. Using FLIX,implementors of static analyses can express a broader range of analyses than is currently possible in pure Datalog, while retaining its familiar rule-based syntax. We define a model-theoretic semantics of FLIX as a natural extension of the Datalog semantics. This semantics captures the declarative meaning of FLIX programs without imposing any specific evaluation strategy. An efficient strategy is semi-naïve evaluation which we adapt for FLIX. We have implemented a compiler and runtime for FLIX, and used it to express several well-known static analyses, including the IFDS and IDE algorithms. The declarative nature of FLIX clearly exposes the similarity between these two algorithms.</p> <p>This work has previously been presented at PLDI 2016. The talk will cover some of that material as well as recent developments.</p>

<p>Safety of a distributed protocol means that the protocol never reaches a bad state, e.g., a state where two nodes become leaders in a leader-election protocol. Proving safety is obviously undecidable since such protocols are run by an unbounded number of nodes, and their safety needs to be established for any number of nodes. I will describe a deductive approach for proving safety, based on the concept of universally quantified inductive invariants --- an adaptation of the mathematical concept of induction to the domain of programs. In the deductive approach, the programmer specifies a candidate inductive invariant and the system automatically checks if it is inductive. By restricting the invariants to be universally quantified, this approach can be effectively implemented with a SAT solver.</p><p>This is a joint work with Ken McMillan (MSR), Oded Padon (TAU), Aurojit Panda(Berkeley) , and Sharon Shoham(TAU) and was integrated into the IVY system: http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~odedp/ivy/.

<p>Automating programming and debugging are long-standing goals in computer science. In spite of significant progress in formal methods over the years, we remain very far from achieving these goals. For example, a freshman CS major will typically program circles around today's best program synthesizers. Debugging and verification tools rely on formal specifications, which are hard to provide in many important applications.</p><p>Two critical components of the gap between human and machine programmers are that humans learn from experience, i.e., data, and can easily generalize from incomplete problem definitions. In this talk, I will present a general framework for formal methods, based on Bayesian statistical learning, that aims to eliminate these differences. In our framework, descriptions of programming tasks are seen to be &quot;clues&quot; towards a hidden (probabilistic) specification that fully defines the task. Large corpora of real-world programs are used to construct a statistical model that correlates specifications with the form and function of their implementations. The framework can be implemented in a variety of ways, but in particular, through a neural architecture called Bayesian variational encoder-decoders. Inferences made using the framework can be used to guide traditional algorithms for program synthesis and bug-finding.</p><p>I will show that this data-driven approach can lead to giant leaps in the scope and performance of automated program synthesis and debugging algorithms.  Specifically, I will give a demo of Bayou, a system for Bayesian inductive synthesis of Java programs that goes significantly beyond the state of the art in program synthesis. I will also describe Salento, a debugging system based on our framework that can find subtle violations of API contracts without any kind of specification.</p>

<p>Like many modern programming languages, C++ supports both generic
       programming (templates) and object-oriented programming (inheritance and
  virtual functions). Unlike many modern programming languages, the generic
 programming mechanism does not fully leverage or interact with the type
  system. It amounts to compile-time duck typing: C++ function templates,
  like functions from a non-statically typed programming language, have
  their full interface implicit in their implementations -- making it hard
  to discern what that interface actually is.  The concept of Concepts
  (compile-time typeclasses) was slated for introduction into C++ in
 the C++11 version of the standard, then C++14, then C++17, now C++20... What can
we do to work around their absence?</p><p>Relatedly, how do we bridge the gap
between static and dynamic polymorphism? C++ provides both, and sometimes we
want to mix and mash them. Template tricks can also be done to accomplish this
as well.</p>

<p>Topology, when viewed from an unusual perspective (formal topology), describes how to compute with certain objects that are beyond the reach of induction, such as real numbers, probability distributions, streams, and function spaces. Accordingly, one gets a programming language whose types are spaces and whose functions are continuous maps.</p><p>Does this language have pattern matching? In functional programming, pattern matching allows definition of a function by partitioning the input and defining the result in each case. We generalize to programming with spaces, where patterns need not represent decidable predicates and also may overlap, potentially allowing nondeterministic behavior in overlapping regions. These overlapping pattern matches are useful for writing a wide array of computer programs on spaces, such as programs that make approximate computations or decisions based on continuous values or that manipulate &quot;partial&quot; datatypes.</p><p>This talk will introduce topology from a computational perspective, and explore some programs that can be built with this framework using overlapping pattern matching.</p>

<p>Earlier comparative studies of language support for generic programming (GP) have shown that mainstream object-oriented (OO) languages such as C# and Java provide weaker support for GP as compared with functional languages such as Haskell or SML.</p><p>One reason is that generic mechanisms of C# and Java are based on F-bounded polymorphism, which has certain deficiencies. Some of these deficiencies are eliminated in more recent languages, such as Scala and Kotlin. However, there are peculiarities of object-oriented languages as a whole, which prevent them from being as expressible as Haskell in terms of generic programming.</p><p>In this talk we will cover the main problems of language support for generic programming in C#/Java as well as other modern object-oriented languages, including Scala and Swift. It turns out that all of these languages follow the same approach to constraining type parameters, which leads to inevitable shortcomings. To overcome them, an alternative approach is suggested in several extensions for OO languages, in particular, JavaGenus. The advantages and drawbacks of both approaches will be discussed in the talk.</p><p>Here are Julia's <a href="http://staff.mmcs.sfedu.ru/~juliet/files/materials/seminar-talks/belyakova-PL-sem-2017-slides.pdf">Slides</a>.</p>

Doppio is a JavaScript runtime system that lets developers run unaltered code written in general-purpose languages, such as Java and C/C++, directly inside the browser. Browsix further enhances Doppio with a kernel, processes, and shared operating system resources, letting multiple off-the-shelf programs concurrently interoperate on the same webpage. ReJS is a low-overhead and high-fidelity time-traveling debugger that lets developers instantaneously step forward and backward through a program's execution.

<p>The simply-typed λ-calculus, with only function types, is strongly normalizing, and its program equivalence relation is decidable: unlike in more advanced type system with polymorphism or effects, the natural &quot;syntactic&quot; equivalence (βη-equivalence) corresponds to natural &quot;semantic&quot; equivalence (observational or contextual equivalence), and is decidable. Adding product types (pairs) is easy and preserves these properties, but sums (disjoint unions) are, surprisingly, harder. It is only in 1995 that Neil Ghani proved that the equivalence in presence of sums is decidable, and the situation in presence of the empty type (zero-ary sum) was unknown.</p><p>We propose an equivalence algorithm for sums and the empty type that takes inspiration from a proof-theoretic technique, named &quot;focusing&quot;,designed for proof search. The exposition will be introductory; I will present the difficulties caused by sums and the empty type, present some of the existing approaches for sums in the literature, introduce focusing, and give a high-level intuition of our saturation-based algorithm and its termination argument. No previous knowledge of focusing is assumed. I expect some familiarity with typed lambda-calculi, but will recall all concepts used (for example, βη-equivalence) during the talk.</p>

<p>Hybrid apps help developers build multiple apps for different platforms with less duplicated effort, by providing platform-specific functionality via native code and user interactions via javascript code. however, most hybrid apps are developed in multiple programming languages with different semantics, complicating programming. moreover, untrusted javascript code may access device-specific features via native code, exposing hybrid apps to attacks. Unfortunately, there are no existing tools to detect such vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present HybriDroid, the first static analysis framework for Android hybrid apps. First, we investigate the semantics of interoperation of Android Java and JavaScript. Then, we design and implement a static analysis framework that analyzes inter-communication between Android Java and JavaScript. We demonstrate HybriDroid with a bug detector that identifies programmer errors due to the hybrid semantics, and a taint analyzer that finds information leaks cross language boundaries. Our empirical evaluation shows that the tools are practically usable in that they found previously uncovered bugs in real-world Android hybrid apps and possible information leaks via a widely-used advertising platform.</p><p>The bulk of this presentation will focus on ASE 2016 work on analysis of hybrid apps (1), a blend of per-platform native code and portable JavaScript.

<p>We will present and demonstrate the usefulness of the sequent
calculus as a formal model of computation based on interactions
between producers and consumers of results. This model leads
to a better understanding of call-by-name evaluation by
reconciling the conflicting principles of extensionality and
weak-head evaluation, thus internalizing a known parametricity
result. It allows one to explore two dualities of computation:
the duality between call-by-name and call-by-value, and the
duality between construction and deconstruction. This ultimately
leads to a better linguistic foundation for co-induction as dual
to induction. From a more practical point of view, the sequent
calculus provides a useful inspiration for the design of
intermediate languages.</p>

<p>In this talk I introduce a probabilistic programming language with continuous random variables and soft constraints, define contextual equivalence for the language, and then present a logical relation that is sound with respect to contextual equivalence.</p><p>The question of equivalence for probabilistic programs is interesting and difficult because the meaning of a program is a measure defined by integrating over the space of all of the program's possible evaluations. Thus creating a workable logical relation requires proving integral equalities involving intermediate measures that are ``equal enough'' but still respect contextual equivalence.</p>

<p>Consistency is hard and coordination is expensive. As we move into the
world of connected 'Internet of Things' style applications, or
large-scale mobile applications, devices have less power, periods of
limited connectivity, and operate over unreliable asynchronous
networks. This poses a problem with shared state: how do we handle
concurrent operations over shared state, while clients are offline,
and ensure that values converge to a desirable result without making
the system unavailable?</p>
  <p>We look at a new programming model, called Lasp. This programming
model combines distributed convergent data structures with a dataflow
execution model designed for distribution over large-scale
applications. This model supports arbitrary placement of processing
node: this enables the user to author applications that can be
distributed across data centers and pushed to the edge.</p>

<p>Static program analysis is a powerful technique for maintaining software, with applications such as compiler optimizations, code refactoring, and bug finding. Static analyzers are typically implemented in general-purpose programming languages, such as C++ and Java; however, these analyzers are complex and often difficult to understand and maintain. An alternate approach is to use Datalog, a declarative language. Implementors can express analysis constraints declaratively, which makes it easier to understand and ensure correctness of the analysis. Furthermore, the declarative nature of the analysis allows multiple, independent analyses to be easily combined.</p>
<p>Flix is a programming language for static analysis, consisting of a logic language and a functional language. The logic language is inspired by Datalog, but supports user-defined lattices. The functional language allows implementors to write functions, something which is not supported in Datalog. These two extensions, user-defined lattices and functions, allow Flix to support analyses that cannot be expressed by Datalog, such as a constant propagation analysis. Datalog is limited to constraints on relations, and although it can simulate finite lattices, it cannot express lattices over an infinite domain. Finally, another advantage of Flix is that it supports interoperability with existing tools written in general-purpose programming languages.</p>
<p>This talk provides an overview of the implementation and evaluation of the Flix functional language. The implementation involves abstract syntax tree transformations, an interpreter back-end, and a code generator back-end, and must support a number of interesting language features, such as pattern matching, first-class functions, and interoperability. The evaluation compares the interpreter and code generator back-ends in terms of correctness and performance.</p>

<p>The precise semantics of floating-point arithmetic programs depends on the execution platform, including the compiler and the target hardware. Such platform dependencies infringe on the highly desirable goal of software portability (which is in fact promised by heterogeneous computing frameworks like OpenCL): the same program run on the same inputs on different platforms can produce different results. In other words, portability does not guarantee reproducibility, and this is a more or less accepted state of affairs.</p>
<p>Serious doubts on the portability of numeric applications arise when differences in results are behavioral, i.e. when they lead to changes in the control flow of a program. In this talk I will first present an algorithm that takes a numeric procedure and determines whether a given input can lead to different decisions depending merely on how the arithmetic in the procedure is compiled and executed. I will then show how this algorithm can be used in static and dynamic analyses of programs, to estimate their numeric stability. I will illustrate the results on examples characteristic of numeric computing where control flow divergence actually occurs across different execution platforms.</p>

<p>Symbolic execution, which was introduced more than four decades ago, is typically used in software testing to explore as many different program paths as possible in a given amount of time, and for each path to generate a set of concrete input values exercising it, and check for the presence of various kinds of errors including assertion violations, uncaught exceptions, security vulnerabilities, and memory corruption.  A key limitation of classical symbolic execution is that it cannot generate useful test inputs if the program under test uses complex operations such as pointer manipulations and non-linear arithmetic operations.</p>
<p>Our research on Concolic Testing (also known as DART: Directed Automated Random Testing or Dynamic Symbolic Execution) alleviated the limitations of classical symbolic execution by combining concrete execution and symbolic execution.  We demonstrated that concolic testing is an effective technique for generating high-coverage test suites and for finding deep errors in complex software applications. The success of concolic testing in scalably and exhaustively testing real-world software was a major milestone in the ad hoc world of software testing and has inspired the development of several industrial and academic automated testing and security tools.</p>
<p>One of the key challenges of concolic testing is the huge number of programs paths in all but the smallest programs, which is usually exponential in the number of static branches in the code.  In this talk I will describe MultiSE, a new technique for merging states incrementally during symbolic execution, without using auxiliary variables. The key idea of MultiSE is based on an alternative representation of the state, where we map each variable, including the program counter, to a set of guarded symbolic expressions called a value summary. MultiSE has several advantages over conventional symbolic execution and state merging techniques: 1) value summaries enable sharing of symbolic expressions and path constraints along multiple paths, 2) value-summaries avoid redundant execution, 3) MultiSE does not introduce auxiliary symbolic values, which enables it to make progress even when merging values not supported by the constraint solver, such as floating point or function values.  We have implemented MultiSE for JavaScript programs in a publicly available open-source tool. Our evaluation of MultiSE on several programs shows that MultiSE can run significantly faster than traditional symbolic execution.</p>

<p>Aliasing is a known source of challenges in the context of imperative object-oriented languages, which have led to important advances in type systems for aliasing control. However, their large-scale adoption has turned out to be a surprisingly difficult challenge. While new language designs show promise, they do not address the need of aliasing control in existing languages.</p>
<p>This paper presents a new approach to isolation and uniqueness in an existing, widely-used language, Scala. The approach is unique in the way it addresses some of the most important obstacles to the adoption of type system extensions for aliasing control. First, adaptation of existing code requires only a minimal set of annotations. Only a single bit of information is required per class. Surprisingly, the paper shows that this information can be provided by the object-capability discipline, widely-used in program security. We formalize our approach as a type system and prove key soundness theorems. The type system is implemented for the full Scala language, providing, for the first time, a sound integration with Scala’s local type inference. Finally, we empirically evaluate the conformity of existing Scala open-source code on a corpus of over 75,000 LOC.</p>

<p>Julia, like R, is a dynamic language for scientific computing but, unlike R, it was explicitly designed to deliver performance competitive to traditional batch-compiled languages. To achieve this Julia's designers made a number of unusual choices, including the presence of a set of type annotations that are used for dispatching methods and speed up code, but not for type-checking. The result is that many Julia programs are competitive with equivalent programs written in C. This talk gives a brief overview of the key points of Julia's design and considers whether similar ideas could be adopted in R.</p>

<p>A &quot;type refinement system&quot; is a type system built on top of
a typed programming language, as an extra layer of typing.  Over the
past few years Paul-André Melliès and I have investigated a
categorical foundation for type refinement systems, which is based on
the idea of looking at a type refinement system &quot;backwards&quot;, in terms
of the functor which erases the extra layer of types.  The talk will
give an introduction to this framework as well as to some of the
insights that it offers, such as:</p>
<p>* The idea of viewing Hoare logic as a type refinement system</p>
<p>* The importance of the bifibrational operations of &quot;pushing forward&quot; and
  &quot;pulling back&quot; (which generalize strongest postconditions and weakest preconditions)</p>
<p>* How those operations can be combined with a monoidal closed structure, to
  model type refinement systems built over pure lambda calculus</p>
<p>I will not assume any prior background in category theory, although as background reading audience
members may be interested in the lecture notes for my recent course at OPLSS

A modern web page contains megabytes of HTML, CSS, images, and JavaScript. Loading such a page requires a browser to evaluate a complex dependency graph involving those resources; once the page is loaded, subsequent interactions between those resources and the user can lead to tricky-to-diagnose bugs. In this talk, I'll describe how tracking fine-grained data flows can allow us to reduce page load times by prioritizing the loads of the highest ancestors in the data flow graph. I'll also describe initial work in using data flows to assist with time-travel debugging (in which developers use a logging-and-replay framework to analyze buggy program executions).

This talk reports on some cool ideas I learned during a week-long
seminar in Dagstuhl last month; it will present other people's work,
not my own. It is aimed at an audience interested in programming
language design in general, but not familiar with the theoretical
treatment of pure languages and side-effects.

We shall start with *demos* first, explaining short code examples in
three programming languages: ML with exceptions as a warmup, then the
new language 'Eff' of Matija Pretnar and Andrej Bauer, that first
implemented so-called effect handlers, and finally the language
'Frank' of Conor McBride, that integrates these handlers in a more
uniform style of &quot;effectful call-by-value programming&quot;.

Only second will we discuss some *theory*, in an accessible way:
monads and algebraic effects, which are two distinct ways to formalize
side-effects, and the difference between &quot;direct&quot; and &quot;indirect&quot; style
of effectful programming.

Underlying this talk are two larger, important questions of
programming language design, that will be touched during the talk and

We present a Coq library that lifts an abstract yet precise
notion of running-time into the type of a function. Our library is
based on a monad that counts abstract steps, controlled by one of the
monadic operations. The monad's computational content, however, is
simply that of the identity monad so programs written in our
monad (that recur on the natural structure of their arguments) extract
into idiomatic OCaml code. We evaluated the expressiveness of the
library by proving that red-black tree insertion and search, merge
sort, insertion sort, Fibonacci, iterated list insertion, BigNum
addition, and Okasaki's Braun Tree algorithms all have their expected
running times.

The domain of Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly expanding beyond research and becoming a major industrial market with such stakeholders as major manufacturers of chips and connected objects, and fast-growing operators of low-power wide-area networks. Importantly, this emerging domain is driven by applications that leverage the infrastructure to provide users with innovative, high-value services. Because of this application-centric approach, software development plays a key role to realize the full potential of IoT.

In this talk, we argue that there is a continuum between orchestrating connected objects in the small and in the large, fostering a unified approach to application development. We examine the requirements for orchestrating connected objects and address them with domain-specific design concepts. We then show how to map these design concepts into dedicated programming patterns and runtime mechanisms.

Our work revolves around domain-specific notations integrated into a tool-based design methodology, dedicated to develop IoT applications. We have applied our work across a spectrum of infrastructure sizes; we present examples, ranging from an automated pilot in avionics, to an assisted living platform for the home of seniors, to a parking management system in a smart city.

The optimization component of a compiler takes a program as input and
produces another, hopefully faster, program as output.  At a high level,
optimizers solve a search problem over a space of programs, but the
traditional architecture of a compiler's optimizer does no search at
all.  This talk will present the STOKE project, which is exploring the
use of Monte Carlo search methods as the basis of a modern compiler
optimizer.  We will show that search-based program optimization can
consistently improve, sometimes substantially, on current production
compilers at their highest levels of optimization and can even compete
with expert, hand-written  assembly.  We will also discuss the unique
and challenging verification problems that arise when a compiler
produces code using a random process.

As software becomes increasingly more complex and yet more pervasive, poor understanding of software behavior compromises the quality and the integrity of software systems that we use. In this talk, I will show that automated analysis techniques can help to identify and reason about software behavior characteristics that matter to humans. After a brief overview of my current research directions, I will focus on techniques for identifying privacy violations in mobile applications, i.e., leakages of sensitive information such as user location and shopping preferences. I will present a set of solutions that rely on contextual, functional and usage-based clues for improving the accuracy of leakage detection and for distinguishing between “legitimate” and “illegitimate” information distribution patterns.

Object capabilities are a technique for fine-grained privilege separation in programming languages and systems,with important applications in security. However, current formal characterisations do not fully capture capability-safety of a programming language and are not sufficient for verifying typical applications. Using state-of-the-art techniques from programming languages research, we define a logical relation for a core calculus of JavaScript that better characterises capability-safety. The relation is powerful enough to reason about typical capability patterns and supports evolvable invariants on shared data structures, capabilities with restricted authority over them and isolated components with restricted communication channels. We use a novel notion of effect parametricity for deriving properties about effects. We demonstrate that our results imply memory access bounds that have previously been used to characterise capability-safety.

Emerging consumer electronics products are running the same software platforms that power smartphones. This leads to the appealing idea that a uniform programming abstraction can be used for app development for a range of devices, from wearables to smartphones. In practice, however, devices wary in their hardware capabilities and this has an impact on app development. In this talk, I will focus on ways in which JavaScript may be used and/or run differently to accommodate the different hardware capabilities across devices. Specifically, I will present a subset of JavaScript that strikes a balance between retaining the flavor of JavaScript (e.g. use of prototype inheritance, no explicit type declarations) and the possibility of ahead-of-time compilation to efficient code.

Analyzing real-world web applications is a challenging task. On top of understanding the semantics of JavaScript, it requires modeling of web documents, platform objects, and interactions between them. Most web applications load JavaScript code dynamically, which makes pure static analysis approaches inapplicable. In this talk, we present our journey to analyze JavaScript web applications in the wild using various approaches. From pure JavaScript programs to JavaScript web applications using platform-specific libraries, we explain technical challenges in analyzing each of them and how we built an open-source analysis framework for JavaScript, SAFE, that addresses the challenges incrementally.  Finally, we discuss our ongoing work on analysis of Android hybrid applications.

<p>Multiprocessors and concurrent programming are now pervasive. Typically, they do not guarantee sequential consistency (a.k.a. interleaving semantics), which is the standard assumption by most work on semantics and verification. Instead, they employ subtle memory models, exposing unexpected relaxed behaviors arising from hardware and compiler optimizations.</p>
                   <p>In this talk, I will focus on one such model --- the release-acquire fragment of the C/C++11 memory model. I will describe its merits, and show how it can be further improved, without additional implementation costs, to: (i) forbid dubious behaviors that are not observed in any implementation; (ii) support fence instructions that restore sequential consistency; and (iii) admit an equivalent intuitive operational semantics.</p>

<p>Weak memory models formalize the inconsistent behaviors that one can observe in multithreaded programs running on modern hardware. In so doing, they complicate the already-difficult task of reasoning about correctness of concurrent code. Worse, they render impotent most formal methods that have been developed to tame concurrency, which almost universally assume a strong (i.e., sequentially consistent) memory model. In response, we have developed a number of alternative reasoning techniques that are sound for programs running weak memory consistency. I will cover both program logics, such as relaxed separation logic, as well as theorems that allow reducing reasoning about well-structured weakly consistent implementations down to sequential consistency, and show how these can be applied to reason about a practical RCU implementation.</p>

<p>Compilers form an integral component of the software
development ecosystem. Compiler writers must understand the
specification of source and target languages to design sophisticated
algorithms that transform programs while preserving
semantics. Unfortunately, compiler bugs in mainstream compilers are
common. Compiler bugs can manifest as crashes during compilation, or,
much worse, result in the silent generation of incorrect
programs. Such mis-compilations can introduce subtle errors that are
difficult to diagnose and generally puzzling to software
developers.</p>
<p>The talk will describe the problems in developing peephole
optimizations that perform local rewriting to improve the efficiency
of LLVM code. These optimizations are individually difficult to get
right, particularly in the presence of undefined behavior; taken
together they represent a persistent source of bugs.  The talk will
present Alive, a domain-specific language for writing optimizations
and for automatically either proving them correct or else generating
counterexamples.  A transformation in Alive is shown to be correct
automatically by encoding the transformation into constraints, which
are automatically checked for validity using a Satisfiability Modulo
Theory (SMT) solver. Furthermore, Alive can be automatically
translated into C++ code that is suitable for inclusion in an LLVM
optimization pass.</p>
<p>Alive is based on an attempt to balance usability and formal
methods; for example, it captures—but largely hides—the detailed
semantics of three different kinds of undefined behavior in LLVM. We
have translated more than 300 LLVM optimizations into Alive and, in
the process, found that eight of them were wrong.  I will conclude the
talk highlighting the lessons learned and the challenges in
incorporating lightweight formal methods in the tool-chain of the
compiler developer.</p>

<p>Programmers use profilers to understand the performance
characteristics of
their programs and to focus on those pieces whose improvement may yield the
largest gains. A conventional profiler measures the time that a program
spends in functions, methods, expressions, and statements. Racket's novel
feature-specific profiler supplements this information with timings of
instances of linguistic features. This paper reports the results of a
successful reproducibility effort to adapt feature-specific profiling to
the R programming language. Specifically, the paper demonstrates how easy
and effective it is to add the necessary language support, that the
approach usefully enhances the information produced by a classical
profiler, and that the additional overhead is tolerable.</p>

<p>Performance clearly matters to users. The most common software update
on the AppStore *by far* is &quot;Bug fixes and performance enhancements.&quot;
Now that Moore's Law Free Lunch has ended, programmers have to work
hard to get high performance for their applications. But why is
performance so hard to deliver?</p>
<p> I will first explain why our current approaches to evaluating and
 optimizing performance don't work, especially on modern hardware and
 for modern applications. I will then present two systems that address
 these challenges. Stabilizer is a tool that enables statistically
 sound performance evaluation, making it possible to understand the
 impact of optimizations and conclude things like the fact that the -O2
 and -O3 optimization levels are indistinguishable from noise
 (unfortunately true).</p>
<p> Since compiler optimizations have largely run out of steam, we need
 better profiling support, especially for modern concurrent,
 multi-threaded applications. Coz is a novel &quot;causal profiler&quot; that
 lets programmers optimize for throughput or latency, and which
 pinpoints and accurately predicts the impact of optimizations. Coz's
 approach unlocks numerous previously unknown optimization
 opportunities. Guided by Coz, we improved the performance of Memcached
 by 9%, SQLite by 25%, and accelerated six Parsec applications by as
 much as 68%; in most cases, these optimizations involved modifying
 under 10 lines of code.</p>

            <p>Computer networks do not simply connect machines together, but run several
         applications on network devices, such as load balancers, intrusion detection
         systems, authentication portals, and more. Historically, these applications were
         black-boxes running on proprietary hardware, but software-defined networking
         (SDN) now allows anyone to write their own programs using open networking
         protocols (e.g., OpenFlow). So, what are the right abstractions for programming networks? This talk will try
         to address this question in three ways.</p>
                        <p>First, we present a syntactic theory of network forwarding called NetKAT, which supports equational reasoning about network-wide behavior. Using NetKAT, programmers can ask and answer questions like, &quot;Can A communicate with B?&quot;,
                        &quot;Does all traffic traverse my intrusion detection system?&quot;, &quot;Is there a loop in
my network?&quot;, and so on.</p>
<p>Second, we present a fast and efficient compiler for NetKAT. Although several
network compilers already exist, they are unusable on even moderately sized
networks. Using new data structures and compilation algorithms, our new compiler
is two orders of magnitudes faster than prior work and scales to large
datacenter networks.</p>
<p>Finally, we consider the problem of building a reliable runtime system for
NetKAT. NetKAT abstracts away several low-level details of networking hardware.
Although this is a boon for the network programmer, the burden now shifts to us
to engineer abstractions correctly. We present a Coq-certified runtime system
that is proven correct with respect to a detailed operational model software-
defined networks.</p>

<p>In geo-replicated distributed data stores, the need to ensure responsiveness
   in the face of network partitions and processor failures results in
   implementations that provide only weak (so-called eventually consistent)
   guarantees on when data updated by one process becomes visible to another.
   Applications must be carefully constructed to be aware of unwanted
   inconsistencies permitted by such implementations (e.g., having negative
                                                            balances in a bank account, or having an item appear in a shopping cart
                                                            after it has been removed), but must balance correctness concerns with
                                                            performance and scalability needs.  Because understanding these tradeoffs
                                                            requires subtle reasoning and detailed knowledge about the underlying data
                                                            store, implementing robust distributed applications in such environments is
                                                            often an error-prone and expensive task.</p>

                                                               <p>To overcome these issues, this talk presents a declarative programming model
for eventually consistent data stores called Quelea.  The model comprises a
contract language, capable of defining fine-grained application-level
consistency properties for replicated data types (and transactions over
                                                      objects of these types), and a contract enforcement system to analyze
                                                      contracts and automatically generate the appropriate consistency protocol
                                                      for the method protected by the contract.  By doing so, Quelea enables
                                                      programmers to reason compositionally about consistency from the perspective
                                                      of high-level application requirements, not low-level implementation
                                                      features.</p>

 <span> This talk is about scalloc, a fast, multicore-scalable, low-fragmentation memory allocator and selfie, a 4000-line implementation of a tiny self-compiling C compiler and a tiny self-executing MIPS emulator for teaching systems engineering. Scalloc is a typical example of a very complex, multi-year research effort while selfie is, at least for now, a purely educational, many-year effort in teaching compiler, operating system, and virtual machine design based on a single, highly principled software platform. So far scalloc and selfie only share the passion of their authors and are otherwise two distinct projects. Yet earlier versions of selfie, before they were even identified as such, were instrumental in bringing up the generation of students who did scalloc.
The main ideas behind scalloc are: uniform treatment of small and big objects through so-called virtual spans, efficiently and effectively reclaiming free memory through fast and scalable global data structures, and constant-time (modulo synchronization) allocation and deallocation operations that trade off memory reuse and spatial locality without being subject to false sharing. The main ideas behind selfie are: a compiler written in and for a tiny subset of C called C* which uses the dereferencing * operator of C for memory access but lacks data structures and many other features and a MIPS emulator written in C* that can execute itself. Both are combined and extended by students to do very cool stuff.</span>

<div class="pn-abstract-bio"><p class="pn-title-2">Abstract</p>
<span>  Memory corruption plagues systems since the dawn of computing. With the
rise of defense techniques like stack cookies, ASLR, and DEP, attacks
have become much more complicated, yet control-flow hijack attacks are
still prevalent. Attacks leverage code reuse attacks, often using some
form of information disclosure. Stronger defense mechanisms have been
proposed but none have seen wide deployment so far (i) due to the time
it takes to deploy a security mechanism, (ii) incompatibility with
specific features, and (iii) most severely due to performance overhead.
In the talk, we evaluate the security benefits and limitations of the
status quo and look into upcoming defense mechanisms (and their attacks).

Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) and Code-Pointer Integrity (CPI) are two of
the hottest upcoming defense mechanisms. CFI guarantees that the runtime
control flow follows the statically determined control-flow graph. An
attacker may reuse any of the valid transitions at any control flow
transfer. CPI on the other hand is a dynamic property that enforces
memory safety guarantees like bounds checks for code pointers by
separating code pointers from regular data. We will discuss differences
and advantages/disadvantages of both approaches, especially the security
benefits they give under novel attacks like Counterfeit Object-Oriented
Programming (COOP) and Control-Flow Bending (CFB).  COOP reuses complete
functions as gadgets and CFB bends the control flow along valid but
unintended paths in the control-flow graph of a program.

<span>      Modern verification techniques are becoming
ever-more powerful and sophisticated, and building tools to implement
them is a time-consuming and difficult task. Writing a new verifier to
validate each on-paper approach is impractical; for this reason
intermediate verification languages such as Boogie and Why3 have become
popular over the last decade. However, verification approaches geared
around complex program logics (such as separation logic) have typically
been implemented in specialised tools, since the reasoning is hard to
map down to first-order automated reasoning. In practice, this means
that a rich variety of modern techniques have no corresponding tool
support.  In this talk, I will present the new Silver intermediate
verification language, which has been designed to facilitate the
lightweight implementation of a variety of modern methodologies for
program verification. In contrast to lower-level verification languages,
Silver provides native support for heap reasoning; modes of reasoning
such as concurrent separation logic, dynamic frames and
rely-guarantee/invariants can be simply encoded.  Silver has been
developed as part of the Viper project, which provides two automated
back-end verifiers for Silver programs. Since releasing our software in
September last year, it has been used for (internal and external)
projects to build tools for Java verification, non-blocking concurrency
reasoning, flow-sensitive typing and reasoning about GPU and Linux
kernel code.</span>

concurrent traces. In our work, we focus on trace sets that contain all
correct or all incorrect permutations of events from a given trace. We
represent such trace sets as Boolean combinations of happens-before

drive diverse verification, fault localization, repair, and synthesis
techniques for concurrent programs. In the remainder of the talk, I will

<p>The junior PL seminar
(<a href="http://lists.ccs.neu.edu/pipermail/pl-sem-jr">mailing list</a>)
(<a href="https://github.com/nuprl/prl-seminar-junior/wiki">home page</a>):
a regular student-only seminar, suitable for those new to the study of programming languages.</p>
<br />
<p>The PL Seminar, Jr. is a seminar where students new to the area can discuss the study of programming languages. This seminar is not intended to replace the main PL Seminar, but we hope that it can augment that by providing a place where junior students can discuss topics and ask questions at a pace better suited to our level of knowledge. Topics include:
<ul><li>Design and analysis of programming languages: syntax, semantics, pragmatics (ie, how do you use a language feature in real programs?)</li>
<li>Implementation of programming languages</li>
<li>Program development, both large and small</li>
<li>Programming pedagogy</li>
<li>Programming tools and environments</li>
<li>and anything else that catches our interest.</li></ul>
Topics are not limited to current research, but include older papers, textbook chapters, and surveys.</p>
<br />
<h4>Why PL Seminar, Jr.?</h4>
<small><p>In many ways, the existing PL Seminar doesn't serve junior students well. For us, it is intended to provide an environment where we can go to listen to current research. While nobody expects us to understand the entire presentation, we would ideally be able to say, &quot;I didn't understand that, but it sounded really neat.&quot; By and large, that hasn't happened, for a number of reasons:
<ul><li>For many of us, once our level of comprehension drops below a certain threshold, we tend to get frustrated and tune out. It's very difficult to say that something sounds interesting when you don't even feel like you understand the language.</li>
<li>The discussion environment isn't really helpful to junior students. The questions from the audience are typically research-oriented; often, a great deal of background knowledge is required to follow the ensuing discussions.</li>
<li>To overuse a metaphor, the bandwidth available for discussion tends to be filled by a relatively small number of people; it's often difficult for a junior student to get a word in edgewise.</li></ul></p></small>

<small><p>For this seminar to be as useful as possible, it is important we establish the right &quot;seminar culture.&quot; This is, of course, something that is hard to describe, and it will shift and evolve. However, there are some guidelines for what we are trying to accomplish:
<ul><li>Attendees are willing to learn and to help others learn. They should not come in order to demonstrate how much smarter they are than everyone else just because they know so much more about a specific topic.</li>
<li>Active listening is encouraged. Ask questions! In particular, while research questions are of course welcome, basic comprehension questions are especially encouraged. If you don't understand something, or if you don't believe a step in a proof, ask!</li>
<li>An important corollary: no question is too stupid to ask. This places an obligation on other members of the seminar: rather than express frustration at the basic nature of a question, look at it as an opportunity to practice your skills in explaining things.</li>
<li>Of course, while active listening is a good thing, we want to avoid having a few people fill the communications channel. So, please be considerate of the other people present and allow them to join the discussions as well.</li></ul>
<p>Any attendee may propose a topic; we'll solicit volunteers to present a survey of the area. We expect that most of the presenters will be junior PL students, although outside presentations are welcome.</p></p></small></div></div></div></div></div></div>
